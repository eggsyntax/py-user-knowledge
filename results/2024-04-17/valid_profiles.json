so if you're looking for someone fun to do stuff with, let me know!\ncurrently i work for the government, pushing paper and explaining to people why i can't help them all day. i am pursuing a master's of social work degree at cal state east bay and i secretly want to own a restaurant someday. i am very ambitious about my future and wherever i land i hope to be working with people and enjoying the challenges.\ncooking! i come from a family that knows how to make anything taste good.\nmy eyes and my smile. personality wise people notice that i am quiet and shy at first.\ni love boxing movies. i am a huge rocky fan and i also love bloodsport. i really like crime investigation and courtroom dramas like jag or the closer. i am a fan of the bay area hip hop scene and i love crown city rockers and jurassic five (wish they were still together!) i really like 80's music and some of the early 90's stuff. lately i've been listening to a lot of reggae because i like to pretend i am on vacation.

love them too, my little apartment, some source of heat (i hate being cold)...it's a bit hard to think of six, once i've got family and friends everything else is just material.\nthe future. i have been thinking about what is going to happen to this country a lot. also spending time thinking about what i can do to make this world a better place. i know that sounds like a cheesy ms. america answer but that is what on my mind lately. oh...and i am always wondering what i am going to eat for dinner.\nusually go out and have dinner or some drinks with friends.\ni have type 1 diabetes, but

time). definitely not a morning person. my sense of humor can either be risqu or just downright silly. usually both. i am a good speaker. i'm a better listener. i am opinionated yet very open-minded. i am spontaneous yet organized. i am artistic. i notice and appreciate the little things in life.  what do i like? people that stand out, without trying to stand out. sometimes the most beautiful

harmonic sweetness, and i spend many hours honing my craft. it's become almost a spiritual practice which has started to pay some worldly dividends. - i'm into silliness, often accompanied by dorkiness. - if you get to know me, you will soon embark on conversations that meander like explorations, whether they be outlandish, practical, darkly-cynical, silly, over-the-top self-mocking, deeply-philosophical/bordering-on-spiritual. i like it when people let go of insecurities and are willing to take a chance with words and thoughts. - i'm a life-explorer: from the ivy league to cutting-edge genomics labs to the lecturer's lectern at a singaporean college, from gospel choirs in west oakland to opera house stages in new zealand, the adventure continues... - money, status and image aren't that important to me, but it is nice to have a little moolah in the bank for a rainy day - i'm a great eating partner -- my favorite cuisines are all of them, each of which i like a lot.

graves, the elegance of the hedgehog by muriel barbery, life of pi by yann martel, most anything from isabel allende, harry potter collection, books by david sedaris the list goes on. i try to always have a book to read.  i wish i had time to read the new yorker more often.  music: house, pop, rock, r and b, jazz, classical. i like almost all music and will listen to what i need to set the mood. however, i lean toward music with up-tempo happy sounds. there's always some madonna in my ipod for my workouts.  food: i'll try almost anything once if not twice to make sure of my opinion. i have found that my palate changes over time and what i didn't like in the past can be a future favorite. i'm happy to talk food for hours with you. i love to cook and feed the people in my life. come over and have a bottle of wine and cheese with me, life's good.\nin no particular order. i put 7 and broke the rule.  family - i'm very close to my parents and sister.  friends - i try to keep my long term relationships alive this is not always easy. especially when some of my relationships at 15-20 old and our lives go in different directions but i always have room in my heart.  cheese - yummy!  wine - yummy!  movies - sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, classics, thrillers... to name a few genres. i'll watch any movie with parker posey and meryl streep. i used to have a fascination with horror films and i think i'm out growing it, however, i can't stop from renting the saw series not matter how awful. i like historical or period movies for the history, costumes and general nostalgia.  sex - it's natural and a good stress reliever.  books - what would i do on my breaks and bart if i didn't have my books?\nthe present and future.\nwatching and moving and eating pizza. wishing i did not have to work on sat so i could go out dancing or cause general mischief.\nthis is a question i am willing to answer if it is well earned. i don't know you yet so we will have to wait.\nyou feel we have something in common or something to learn from each other. i'm very open to new people.\n", "essays_len": 2717}, {"age": "no", "status": "single", "sex": "m", "orientation": "straight", "education":

watch it all the time, but i tivo my favorite shows and watch when i can. i love glee! i also watch crime shows, law & order, csi, etc. my taste in books and music is eclectic. mysteries are a favorite, and i love to read novels, memoirs, historical fiction, and i've recently rediscovered my love for young adult novels, thanks to library school. i also love books on tape; i listen while i do the dishes or take walks. i listen to npr a lot, either live or the podcasts of some of my favorites: wait, wait, don't tell me, this american life, fresh air, and the sunday puzzle. as i mentioned, my music taste is eclectic: show tunes, ella fitzgerald, louis armstrong, shawn colvin, ani difranco, bob marley, black eyed peas, yo-yo ma, dixie chicks, carolina chocolate drops, lyle lovett, tracy chapman, the cast of glee, and i could go on  and i love good food. good is not necessarily fancy. there's a taco truck i know that rocks, and when food is really fresh it tastes good almost no matter how it is prepared. oh, and i love musicals, not all of them, but a lot. i rarely get to go to live theater, but when i do get to see a musical, i am thrilled!\n\n\ni don't know that there's a typical. if i have my kids, which is half the time, i'm with them, and maybe some of our friends will come over for dinner. if i don't have the boys, i will either be out to dinner with a friend or friends or home, with friends or by myself enjoying some precious alone time, ahhhh.\n\n\n", "essays_len": 2520}, {"age": "no", "status": "single", "sex": "m", "orientation": "straight",

lived in various corners of india), experiencing different cultures exhilarates me: people, food, music and photographs. i find it interesting that even though there are so many differences between cultures, deep down, we are all the same. so it seems apt that now i live in one of the most diverse cities in the us. i enjoy participating in events which have a cultural tinge to them, like the chinese new year parade. i went a step ahead and actually participated in the parade.. was part of one of the dragons in there. it was amazing!  i am a hopelessly positive person and believe that

i'm reading maimonides right now. i just read the brothers k and it might be my new favorite, but i've felt this way about a lot of novels in the past - tropic of cancer, venus in furs, immortality. i like borges's essays and the poetry of rilke a lot.  european new wave films are always a blast. if you like both the mountain goats and brahms, we'll get along. i can do amazing things with eggplants and lentils. i follow mad men. artists should be here too, so: i'm in love with gerhard richter and cindy sherman.\nexpectations, libraries, a notebook, complications and surprises, intellectuals,

textbook to whatever else sounds interesting. i firmly believe that the intrinsic reward one receives from learning something new is one of life's greatest gifts.\ni'm a software engineer at a startup.  like many stanford computer science grads, i love startups. the team camaraderie, the passion, and the chance to learn something new every day make going to work a lot of fun.  at this point, i see myself working at one (either as a founder or engineer) for the foreseeable future.\nnot taking things too seriously math shooting a basketball\nmy hair can be kind of crazy.\nbooks: to kill a mockingbird, lonesome dove, the stand, catch-22, the denial of death, the blank slate  tv shows / movies: the wire, arrested development, buffy the vampire slayer, the godfather, the empire strikes back, juno  food: i'll eat almost anything. i particularly enjoy cheese.\nwikipedia friends / family (of course) good books basketball occasional peace and quiet melted cheese\nfinding new ways to learn and challenge myself.\nreading or relaxing with friends\ni really like my darth vader pajama pants.\nyou're smart, interesting, and nice... i know, pretty generic requirements; i'm not

that i'd like to hang out with, why do i only have the option to 'suggest to meet' instead of being able to message them first!? i'm not looking for a piece of ass, i'm just looking to meet people and have fun.**  i'm an artist, a craftsman, and a musician with an affinity for the days of old when everything was authentic, american made, and craftsmen were just as valuable if not more valuable than the scholars. alot of my older friends tell me i was born into the wrong era and i think that's very true. i love hearing old stories and it would've been great to experience the 50s through the 70s when life was carefree and big brother had less control.  i currently work in wholesale auto parts during the day and back at my live/work shop in the evenings customizing american cars, motorcycles, guitars, and anything else that's worth chopping up, welding, grinding, and painting. i blow minds! i can make any piece of crap look interesting and new.  on the weekends i'm usually at my shop working and listening to music, bbqing, out riding, going to concerts, movies, car and bike shows, bars, and anything else on a whim.  i like spending time with creative, wild, spontaneous, and intelligent people. i am a gentleman and i'm usually quite reserved, but i enjoy being out of my element and challenging my comfort zone. i read people very well, but i don't like to rely on first impressions because there's always more to someone than what meets the eye and the front that some people choose to put up. i am on the other hand brutally honest and direct with my opinions, sometimes inappropriately. so if you can't handle that, then fuck you.  that said, i enjoy meeting new people and i can get along with almost anybody as long as their ego doesn't get in the way. i've

explain and give sense to some of the nonsensical things in this world. i'm very opinionated, curious, a bit random on thought patterns and very thirsty for knowledge. life offers many challenges and i enjoy nothing more than having the tools and the ability to face said challenges with many options in hand.  i am creative, inquisitive, and odd\nnomy thesis so i can get my master's degree. i also work at the san francisco zoo. i've recently taken up to building computer rigs (just for fun).\nvideo games, learning, research, figuring things out.\ndunno... probably how i can hide accent.\ni'm not that much of a book reader but i do love me some fantasy, science fiction and horror. my fav books are faith and fire, and world war z.  i love movies. but i can be very critical of them sometimes. however, i love zombie movies, action movies, comedy, horror. mostly guy genre's, but i can be easily persuaded to watch other genres. my fav movie of all time is terminator 2.  i'm very picky of what i listen to. amon amarth, carcass, children of bodom, samael, arch enemy, project hate, gardenian, lordi, and a few others. very into metal, mostly of the \"death\" variety, but i do enjoy other genres especially 80's music (any 80's). there are some genre's however that i like to avoid at all costs (i'm looking at you regeatton!).  with food, it's probably easier to list what i don't like. milk (just the liquid, love everthing made from it), cream cheese (love all other cheese varieties), seafood (except tuna, catfish, and shark), and beans (except green beans). i'm very open minded about food, and if you have any food experiments you would like to try out, i'll be a very willing guinea pig...... no pun intended.\ninternet, computers, my eyes (need to see), food, tape and a hammer.\nthings that fascinate me. sometimes it is random things like how i'm gonna change the name of our planet to \"terror dome\".\nhanging out with my friends, goofing off, and

of my favorite things to do is to get my some friends, my boots or my bike or my car, and go exploring. whether it's local or far away, i love having adventures and new places.\nha! this sounds like something out of a self-help book! life to me is about be-ing not do-ing. it's a wonderful moment in time, not somethings that is done. seriously though, i'm trying to make plastic solar cells last longer. one day i hope to launch or be a part of a start-up.\nnot being afraid to tell the truth like it is, generating ideas, being able to ask for what i want, seeing things way before other people see them (because my eyesight is really good), cutting onions, and oh yea, love letters.\ni tell funny stories, my charisma, and that i'm radically honest.\nfor music i really like the black keys, local natives, belle and sebastian, and tame impala. i really like live music, especially when it's animal collective. i'm currently reading walden by thoreau. i really like it's always sunny in philadelphia. for foods i never met a vegetable or a fruit that i didn't like; well, except maybe durians.\n1. family and friends 2. the outdoors 3. volunteer work 4. old fashioned romance 5. wilco and leonard cohen 6. spicy food!!\nhow the many problems that we face as a society could be made in to opportunities.\ni usually play basketball at the gym on friday evenings. afterwards i'll go to a house party or go to the city with friends. otherwise, i'll be packing my bags for a weekend camping trip.\ni can't somersault! there i came clean! now you know the real me.\nif you are passionate,

learning to kite surf and reading some bukowski, among other things.  i love meeting all kinds of people, especially if you're able to make me think or introduce me to a new experience (welding? surfing? knitting?).  i value intellect, openness, intimacy, and adventure/exploration. a strong sense of curiosity, in my opinion, is one of the most attractive traits a person can have.\ni fly gliders, take pictures and start companies. i'm going to be taking off early next year for a couple months of travel. my plan is to ask friends all over the country (and world) to recommend a single book, and then visit each person for as long as it takes to read each book. and, of course, write about the experience.  my current startup is focused on making the experience of mobile pedestrian navigation in cities delightful by showing people awesome things along the way.\nseeing the extraordinary in the supposedly mundane, catching things that are falling, exploring random thought cul-de-sacs, making campfires the old fashioned way.\nthe other day i knocked a cup off a table because my hands couldn't resist becoming active participants of the conversation i was having. i'll go with that.\nkurt vonnegut, hunter s. thompson, jack kerouac, neruda, rumi, o' henry, t.s. eliot, anne carson.  a few songs that make my mind tingle: the purple bottle (animal collective), say yes (elliott smith), king of carrot flowers (neutral milk hotel), fearless (pink floyd), passing afternoon (iron and wine), moon shadow (cat stevens), all of abbey road, but especially side b.  i recently learned how to make lox from fresh salmon, which has improved my quality of life considerably.\nfamily, legs, intricate conversations, dance music, mountains/ocean (need one or the other at any given time), adventure\nthe way things tend to fade into the background as we become more habituated to them (and conversely how to re-notice things), whether i'm learning enough fast enough, how to avoid getting caught in the sf trolly tracks on my bike, what people think imparts knowledge vs what actually does, how to build a company that actually improves people's lives.  and... logic puzzles. i love 'em. yep, suppose i'm a bit of a nerd in that regard.\nbased on my last three friday nights i'm either: 1. camping in wisconsin 2. bbq-ing, chatting and smoking a pipe with a friend or 3. doing

green thing you hear about on tv.\nmy computer aided design skills have kept me busy (employed) for the last 20 years so i guess i'm good at that. otherwise, i don't know, what are you into? wanna talk architecture, skiing, mountain biking, guitar / music,  browsing the internet? maybe (hopefully) you'll humble me. ??\nreally have no idea but maybe that i can be a little intense at times.\nbooks: honestly, i don't read books (novels) that often if at all. although i'm not that religious, i have been reading and discussing the bible a lot lately.  movies: honestly again, i don't have tv (cable tv that is, i do have' a tv) and haven't seen too many movies in the theater in the last several years. i do like them though! just something i never do alone.  music: love music and watching people play live. i definitely prefer small venues over big shows. you know, shows small enough so you can see what chords they are playing. also, try to stick to the rock / alternative / electronica side of things. i really not into punk, thrash / pop metal, or pop hip-hop / r&b / country.  food: making a dinner to share is a lot of fun but eating out is great too. food always taste better with others around.\na computer / drafting board (mostly a computer), work, family  mother and brother especially, improvement, a hot shower, and the occasional party' (aka festive occasion).\nhow to make six acres of land livable and sustainable with little money while keeping / improving the inherent beauty it already possesses. architecture / work and how to pay the bills.

- both put the biggest smile on my face.  i'm dedicated, usually confident, quiet, thoughtful, and i go out of my way to do nice things for people for its own sake. sometimes i'm intensely analytical, sometimes i'm intensely passionate, sometimes both. i'm a good listener, i don't play games with people, and even though i'm terribly shy sometimes, i'm pretty bold other times.  i really like being silly and spontaneous, but i need encouragement from people who are just naturally like that.  i like salsa dancing, community organizing, astrophysics/cosmology, cooking from scratch, 90s hip hop, indigenous ceremony, national liberation movements, legal writing, singing cover songs & playing nylon string guitar, wingchun, serving the people, writing romantic poetry, the labor movement, sci fi, biodiesel (converted my own car), expensive wine, bonsai, eating with my hands, all kinds of plants, kinky sex, weight lifting, teaching myself new stuff, long one on one conversations, romantic dates, razor sharp knives, ping pong, poker, and being at a party and actually not feeling awkward.\nlearning on the job so i can one day become a lawyer for the people, enjoying working 9-5 monday through friday for the first time in my life, getting in shape, getting my forearms beat up training self-defense, learning the art of bonsai, having good times in the kitchen, and lots of other stuff.\ncooking. sure, i screw things up sometimes, but i've had many impressive successes.  listening. every once in a while i catch myself trying to problem solve for somebody when all they wanted was for me to listen, or responding by talking too much about myself, but i'm usually pretty damn good at it.  leading chants in a march or picket line. i've met better, but i'm pretty good at it. me: \"banks got bailed out!\" all y'all: \"we got sold out!\" what a feeling that is.  teaching myself stuff, and sticking with it.\ni have no idea. if you meet me, and remember to tell me later, i'm

my hair compulsively, shake my leg and fidget. possibly that i look bored a lot but if i'm engaged then i giggle often and laugh easily. and that i'm a huge, huge dork.\nmusic: something from everything, but my primary genre is rock or alternative. i dig on some punk rock music and hip hop too. never done much in the way of listening to country except for some johnny cash. i'm a sucker for a good melody and admittedly have a weak spot for some catchy pop. what am i listening to a lot nowadays? feral children, adele, fucked up, del the funky homosapien, nicki minaj, modest mouse, dion and the belmonts, lil' wayne. always loving: kyuss, band of horses, the bronx, led zeppelin, some rolling stones, cat power, tom waits, atmosphere, m.i.a., rancid, eminem, beirut, ministry, norma jean, pearl jam and red hot chili peppers from back in the day, radiohead, jimi hendrix, saul williams, the clash, and so on.  books: fiction/fantasy. hmm also maybe a bit eclectic. to start with - blood meridian, world war z (total epic of awesome), alice munro, neil gaiman stuff both sandman graphic novels and regular books like american gods and neverwhere. i've got a lifelong, off and on comic book love. getting into history a little more now like confederates in the attic and this new book about lincoln. i have totally read every harry potter book multiple times aaaand . . . yeah there's others.  movies: adventure/fantasy type movies, and i love comedies. layer cake, smoking aces part one, hot tub time machine, the hangover. sometimes i like social/cultural documentaries, e.g. good hair, which was funny and super interesting about the social/economic influences behind how people do their hair. it's insane.  shows: 2 broke girls, the daily show, old school fan of buffy, lost, 30rock, breaking bad, vampire diaries and the rachel maddow show when i'm feeling smart.  food: oh my god i love food. except sushi. don't ask me why but i'm just not into it. i love pizza, burritos, thai food, diner food, and food that caters to my sweet tooth.\n\nwhy the inside of my brain looks like a giant cartoon. that changes channels ever two minutes. what do i spend a lot of time thinking about? good question, i'll have to think about this one!\ndoing any number of things. i work weekends so friday nights need moderation though i usually go out anyway. i could be working, or under my down blanket on my laptop and the cats laying on top of me. or i might be stuffing my mouth with pizza, a joint, or a beer or two with friends at someone's house or somewhere else where there's no cover charge.\noh honey, you have to earn that.\nmy profile appeals to you. fyi i'm not into high maintenance people prone to playing games at all. aside from that i don't know exactly what i'm looking for in another person right now. i know that i'm not wired well for casual hookups so while i'm not hunting for a life partner i'm also not looking for one night stands. i'd love to meet people who are grounded, easygoing, kind, and who can be happy without a significant other (irrelevant to whether or not you want one). i'm happy to meet, talk, hang out, and then just take it from there. oddballs and people with some freak going on are also welcome ;)\n", "essays_len": 5795}, {"age": "no", "status": "single", "sex": "m", "orientation": "straight", "education": "yes",

week-daily basis...not sure how i feel about the commute yet, since i'm losing 8-10 hours a week on the road.  i usually do a lot of active/athletic/outdoor things when i am not pursuing my other hobbies or hanging out with my friends. just over year ago, i had a knee injury that i just recently had minor knee surgery to fix (see photo), so i am currently finishing up physical therapy so i can start getting back into shape soon. typically i do triathlons and play soccer to stay in shape. a fun triathlon that i do every year (and alluded to in my summary earlier) is the iron stomach

to cook for 4 than just for 1, in my opinion. sometimes i'll invite a dozen or two of my friends over and cook a sit down meal. i also enjoy trying new things at restaurants and thinking about how to recreate them in my kitchen.  -sports: in college, i played several sports (at various times) as an undergrad on the east coast at the varsity and club level, including swimming, crew, ultimate frisbee, and table tennis. i generally keep in pretty good shape (not counting time rehabbing from injuries). after moving to the bay area, i have taken up cycling in order to do triathlons. i've done events such as the sf marathon, wharf-to-wharf, the iron stomach triathlon and i've escaped from alcatraz too. i also play soccer on a town league team.  -organizing and planning the logistics of getting large groups of my friends to eat out, eat in, go out, etc. we call them food adventures. food happens to be the things that most people remember, but we do other things as well (concerts,

-cheering for the red sox. sorry bay area teams! there were no baseball teams near me growing up, so i became a boston fan when i was in college...but only after pedro won me over by coming in for

good company.", "essay3": "people generally seem to notice that i am typically calm, enjoy food, and stay active.  also, the following dialog usually comes up, i'd say 50% of the time, when i meet

didn't really experience growing up in the south.  of course i am also a huge fan of southern and cajun cuisines, but i have not found any good places around here yet, so i often try to replicate those. i also love banh mi (vietnamese sandwiches) and pho. i enjoy soups a great deal. but i generally enjoy most foods i have come across, to be fair. despite owning a deep fryer and an ice cream maker (given to me under protest from my friends), i love my vegetables too.  a couple of my favorite movies include groundhog day, the matrix, grosse pointe blank, the shawshank redemption, the wedding singer, armageddon (sometimes i just want to see things go *boom*), remember the titans, ratatouille, the princess bride, the neverending story, and cool hand luke.  i usually watch tv to take a break from other things or when i have to do work on the computer. the tv shows i enjoy when i have the time are the office, parks and rec, 30 rock, modern family, community, how i met your mother, psych, and game of thrones (winter is coming back 4/1!). other examples of shows i have enjoyed that have finished their tv runs recently are battlestar galactica, arrested development, farscape, and scrubs.  i'm generally not too picky about music, but i do have soft spots for bad 80s music and classical music (i used to play the piano and the violin). my mp3 player usually contains music with a strong beat as i usually use that for biking and running. anywhere else, i generally have the radio on random stations to hear what's currently out there.  favorite books to come.", "essay5": "six

(dec 2011) and i am now starting the next phase of my career in industry. this task occupies most of my daylight hours, but that's cool because it's interesting and i get to play with machines that help people stay healthy and from going blind. right now i am commuting to dublin on a week-daily basis...not sure how i feel about the commute yet, since i'm losing 8-10 hours a week on the road.  i usually do a lot of active/athletic/outdoor things when i am not pursuing my other hobbies or hanging out with my friends. just over year ago, i had a knee injury that i just recently had minor knee surgery to fix (see photo), so i am currently finishing up physical therapy so i can start getting back into shape soon. typically i do triathlons and play soccer to stay in shape. a fun triathlon that i do every year (and alluded to in my summary earlier) is the iron stomach triathlon. this was a trip...do a lake swim, eat some doughnuts, bike, eat double cheeseburgers and fries, run, chug two beers, and sprint to the finish!  i also enjoy cooking, eating, and going on food adventures with my friends.\n-cooking: i read cookbooks from cover to cover (and i have many because i collect them), and i love to cook for my friends and family. it's just as easy to cook for 4 than just for 1, in my opinion. sometimes i'll invite a dozen or two of my friends over and cook a sit down meal. i also enjoy trying new things at restaurants and thinking about how to recreate them in my kitchen.  -sports: in college, i played several sports (at various times) as an undergrad on the east coast at the varsity and club level, including swimming, crew, ultimate frisbee, and table tennis. i generally keep in pretty good shape (not counting time rehabbing from injuries). after moving to the bay area, i have taken up cycling in order to do triathlons. i've done events such as the sf marathon, wharf-to-wharf, the iron stomach triathlon and i've escaped from alcatraz too. i also play soccer on a town league team.  -organizing and planning the logistics of getting large groups of my friends to eat out, eat in, go out, etc. we call them food adventures. food happens to be the things that most people remember, but we do other things as well (concerts, musuems, shows, etc).  -games: i pick up card games, board games, and general group games pretty quickly. some of my favorites are poker, settlers of catan, the great dalmuti and trivial pursuit.  -cheering for the red sox. sorry bay area teams! there were no baseball teams near me growing up, so i became a boston fan when i was in college...but only after pedro won me over by coming in for relief against cleveland and throwing 6 inning of no-hit ball.  -camping and hiking: my favorite thing about camping is going to the outdoors, making a fire, and watching it go all night with some good company.\npeople generally seem to notice that i am typically calm, enjoy food, and stay active.  also, the following dialog usually comes up, i'd say 50% of the time, when i meet someone new:  other people: \"so where are you from?\" me: \"baton rouge, louisiana\" other people: \"wow! you don't have an accent.\"\nmy all-time favorite meal is the traditional thanksgiving meal (turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce, stuffing or dressing, green beans, sweet potatoes, butternut squash soup, rolls, apple pie, pumpkin pie, etc). however, i pretty much like most cuisines i come across, and i especially enjoy the german, ethiopian, japanese/sushi, and thai restaurants that i have found around the bay area since moving here 8 years ago, which i didn't really experience growing up in the south.  of course i am also a huge fan of southern and cajun cuisines, but i have not found any good places around here yet, so i often try to replicate those. i also love banh mi (vietnamese sandwiches) and pho. i enjoy soups a great deal. but i generally enjoy most foods i have come across, to be fair. despite owning a deep fryer and an ice cream maker (given to me under protest from my friends), i love my vegetables too.  a couple of my favorite movies include groundhog day, the matrix, grosse pointe blank, the shawshank redemption, the wedding singer, armageddon (sometimes i just want to see things go *boom*), remember the titans, ratatouille, the princess bride, the neverending story, and cool hand luke.  i usually watch tv to take a break from other things or when i have to do work on the computer. the tv shows i enjoy when i have the time are the office, parks and rec, 30 rock, modern family, community, how i met your mother, psych, and game of thrones (winter is coming back 4/1!). other examples of shows i have enjoyed that have finished their tv runs recently are battlestar galactica, arrested development, farscape, and scrubs.  i'm generally not too picky about music, but i do have soft spots for bad 80s music and classical music (i used to play the piano and the violin). my mp3 player usually contains music with a strong beat as i usually use that for biking and running. anywhere else, i generally have the radio on random stations to hear what's currently out there.  favorite books to come.\nsix things i could never do without include (besides food, shelter, oxygen, etc): 1) friends/family/loved ones 2) sports/staying fit 3) cooking 4) something interesting to do 5) background noise 6) some sort of timepiece\n\non a typical friday night, i am usually in the midst of game/potluck night, dinner/movie night, or out with friends somewhere. i might even take the night off if it's been a long week or i have a race/long training session early the next day. it really just depends on that particular week or friday.\ni'll give you a couple:  1) i was an eagle scout growing up. 2) i had a nasty run in with some disney princesses a few years ago. 3) i've only had a smartphone for ~3 months now. 4) i enjoy food photography, or rather documenting my food and culinary adventures. so basically, i often whip out my camera to take pictures of things i have prepared or foods that i have procured. i try to be polite about it in front of company, but most everyone i know is used to it by now.\n-you appreciate a home-cooked meal...even better if you enjoy cooking with other people. or if you are fond of cleaning dishes! -you share some of my interests, especially the active/sports aspect of my life, but you'll introduce me to new things, and try the new opportunities i might offer you. -you think we have some things in common and that we might get along, so you want to exchange some messages or meet up to find out it that is indeed the case. -you are in the sf bay area\n", "essays_len": 7879}, {"age": "no", "status": "single", "sex": "m", "orientation": "gay", "education": "no",

hiking, yoga/pilates, swimming, i keep my week busy maintaining a healthy body/mind.  when i have free time, i enjoy painting and various creative interior redesign projects. i love photography. i'm a
