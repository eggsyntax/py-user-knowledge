sort of kidding. mostly i'm looking for people who are smart and aware and are interested in the world and other people. this can manifest in many ways, from genuinely caring about someone's perspectives and experiences, to being well read and travelled and eager to learn more.  also, i would say not taking yourself too seriously...though i'm never really sure what other people mean when they say that. for me it's sort of like getting over yourself, being patient and generous with others and understanding that they often don't mean to cause offense.  any one of the following would also be awesome:  1. you enjoy food and aren't a very picky eater. i eat out a lot and really love trying to new foods. you don't have to be a foodie, (though i definitely have been called that many times), but you should at least be open to the idea of new foods. also--i have an idea for a new food review website for the mission; looking for a food lover to help me get it off the ground.  2. you enjoy reading.  3. you like watching the wire, breaking bad, etc. basically you appreciate the golden age of tv!\n", "essays_len": 5054}, {"age": "no", "status": "single", "sex": "m", "orientation":

(dont ask unless you really want to know.)  i also like to help out my community whenever i can. i help this past october to the children(s) miracle network by organizing a small group in playing video games to help raise money. its not something \"huge\" but its something.  i work out as much as i can when possible these days and like to have fun while doing it. but i gotta stay in shape or at least healthy to go on all these trips and eat all these amazing types of foods!  i recently came back from disneyland and as many times as i go i still think that place is awesome!

[2] connection: in my world, there are five relevant areas in which two people can connect: physical, mental, emotional, spiritual and energetic. all are important for a sustainable long-term intimate relationship. but of course there are different types of relationships, and it sometimes takes a while to figure out what the appropriate type is for the two people involved. indeed, there are more and more complications at every turn. so it goes.  so back to the five levels. two people may well connect on one or more, but to have a sustainable long-term intimate relationship, one needs (or at least i do) to connect on all five. a sign of my maturity, of late, is that i no longer believe that 100% connection on all levels is necessary, but i do think 80% or so on at least most of them is.  but of course people change in both the long and the short term.  anyway, without going on too long here, i hope you get the outline at least of what i'm looking for. i really am open to and hoping to find my life's partner, and to spending the rest of our lives exploring intimacy, connection and joy together in all the relevant ways. wouldn't that be lovely! in the meantime, however, i hope to enjoy the process of finding her, however long that takes.  my main motivating factor in life is to penetrate beneath the surface into the juicy heart of things, thereby inspiring and nourishing everyone i come into contact with. in that light, there is this mysterious dimension called sympathy', electricity', chemistry' or simply energetic connection'. you certainly know it when you feel it; at least i do. and of course that also happens (or can happen) on numerous levels simultaneously, thereby also increasing the complexity of coupling. yipes! why can't things be simple? do you suppose god is jewish too? and that klezmer was the original music of the spheres at creation? (the pythagoreans were so square!)  and speaking of complications, although on some level it seems like it might be fun to be polyamorous, in reality, there is only one thing more complicated that being involved with one woman and that's being involved with more than one!  there you have it, a first approach to articulating my philosophy of relationships. but let there be no doubt: i believe in love and its transformative and redemptive powers. truly, madly, deeply!  i hope you do too.", "essay1": "the main things i'm doing with my life these days are finishing my book on the history of astrology and looking for love. and trying to do as much good and have as much fun as humanly possible.  i am also doing my part to raise a magnificent almost 18 year old daughter who is my pride and joy, the apple of my eye, and a scorpio like her nice old dad. i have learned so much about life (and women!) from getting to know her over the years. every phase has been more wonderful than the last! what a blessing she is, giving me constant hope and faith in an increasingly crazy world.  fyi though, she lives with her mother, not me.  i am also looking for a patron in lieu of the academic position for which i have been searching, mostly in vain. i have, however, had a splendid run of one year jobs and postdoctoral fellowships that have taken me to, among other places, los angeles (the huntington--paradise on earth!) and new york (nyu), cambridge, ma and norman, ok, florence and rome. ah, italy! i have been very fortunate indeed! somehow, if one follows ones bliss, things have a way of working out.  along those lines, i was deeply inspired at a relatively young age by a book called the last barrier by reshad field. he said that the sufis say that our job in this life is to find out our true name (as it were) and to proclaim it every day in every way for the rest of our lives. marsilio ficino says the same thing in his astounding text, the de vita libri tres, especially in the 3rd book, the famous de vita coelitus comparanda (on deriving life from the heavens). [i can't imagine there is much latin on this site; in that light, i'd like to add two more sayings: fortuna favet audaci, and amor vincit omnia!] finally, and also from the reshad field book, i was blown away in my youth by the quotation--ostensibly from st francis-- that \"what we are looking for is what is looking\"!", "essay2": "eating, walking, cuddling, reading, massaging and being affectionate, although not necessarily in that order. i'm also pretty good at reading horoscopes, hint, hint! i'm also really good at listening, and being responsive, as well as being proactive.  i am a great fan of and would very much like to cultivate a regular practice of sacred sensuality/sexuality. in my world, sex and spirit are not in any way irreconcilable.  i'm not particularly good at sitting idly by, or waiting for stuff to happen.  i am also very good at picking produce, both fruits and vegetables.", "essay3": "my intense blue eyes and my smile, perhaps also my posture. they probably also notice that i can be wildly flirtatious, although i've done my best in later years to keep this more under my hat. i can't help it; there's nothing i'd rather have on the end of my line of sight that a beautiful inspiring magnificent woman.", "essay4": "my favorite novel overall is apuleius's golden ass; the most inspiring work of history i've read is frances yates's giordano bruno and the hermetic tradition. i also love tom robbins and alan watts. let's not forget kurt vonnegut, another scorpio with midwestern tendencies. i've also been inspired by the work of franz kafka, who seems to have understood the fundamental absurdities of life more clearly than most. my favorite is the trial. i fear, however, that i don't read much fiction, considering truth to not only be more interesting, but often more beautiful as well.  another of my favorite books is james hillman's brilliant and provocative revisioning psychology.  i also love alan watts's books, including his beautifully titled autobiography: \"in my own way.\" in it, he said that his main goals in life were to \"screw the inscrutable and eff the ineffable.\" i couldn't agree more!  my favorite movies are wings of desire and the wizard of oz. that said, i love cinema of many varieties. i lived in new york last year. one of the best parts about being there was becoming a member of moma, which allowed me access to their amazing film program, where, among other things, i saw the opening of winter's bone, with the director and a number of the actors. what an amazing film.  the best thing i've seen lately though is 'the disappearance of alice creed.' truly brilliant, however disturbing.  and of course i'm a great lover of italian cinema, especially fellini, and within his ouvre, the satyricon.  i love a broad range of music. my favorite bands are u2, bruce springsteen, the doors, and more recently dave matthews and the red hot chili peppers. i also love stravinsky's rites of spring and anything by chet baker. i also love a range of world music, both to listen and dance to, from king sunny ade to boca do rio to bunny wailer.  i shouldn't forget peter gabriel and king crimson from the '80s. living in austin in the '80s was a sublime experience. i crave sublime experiences, not to mention a little ecstasy every now and again (not the drug!).  and i just saw linda tillery in berkeley. they were amazing!  hardly, strictly bluegrass was wonderful. i saw five great acts: trombone shorty, the carolina chocolate drops, doc watson (i hope my groove is still working so well at 87!), nick lowe, and the magnificent sharon jones and the dap kings. what a blast!  concerning food, there is a broad range, once again, but i'm completely smitten these days with an indian buffet joint on 9th avenue. i really do love a broad range of cuisines. one of my favorite newish restaurants is a middle eastern place called jannah. it's affordable and delicious, and the owner is a peach of a man. i got spoiled on middle eastern food while living in pasadena though, in particular armenian food. mm, mm. i also have a taste for polish food, but i won't go any further into that now. and also good old jewish deli. living on the upper west side last year with easy access to murray's and to tal's bagels made my experience there all the more memorable.  my sister is one of the great foodie's of all time. she too lives in sf and always has a memorable restaurant to recommend.", "essay5": "cuddling, good music, good beer, good herb, love and affection. and also my family, who are magnificent!", "essay6": "love, history and the mysteries of life. also why things are as they are, and why our current political situation is so disastrous. you would think that after all these years of human civilization, we would have figured out some of the basics by now. and we have the chutzpah to call ourselves 'homo sapiens'; would that it were so!

[i can't imagine there is much latin on this site; in that light, i'd like to add two more sayings: fortuna favet audaci, and amor vincit omnia!] finally, and also from the reshad field book, i was blown away in my youth by the quotation--ostensibly from st francis-- that \"what we are looking for is what is looking\"!\neating, walking, cuddling, reading, massaging and being affectionate, although not necessarily in that order. i'm also pretty good at reading horoscopes, hint, hint! i'm also really good at listening, and being responsive, as well as being proactive.  i am a great fan of and would very much like to cultivate a regular practice of sacred sensuality/sexuality. in my world, sex and spirit are not in any way irreconcilable.  i'm not particularly good at sitting idly by, or waiting for stuff to happen.  i am also very good at picking produce, both fruits and vegetables.\nmy intense blue eyes and my smile, perhaps also my posture. they probably also notice that i can be wildly flirtatious, although i've done my best in later years to keep this more under my hat. i can't help it; there's nothing i'd rather have on the end of my line of sight that a beautiful inspiring magnificent woman.\nmy favorite novel overall is apuleius's golden ass; the most inspiring work of history i've read is frances yates's giordano bruno and the hermetic tradition. i also love tom robbins and alan watts. let's not forget kurt vonnegut, another scorpio with midwestern tendencies. i've also been inspired by the work of franz kafka, who seems to have understood the fundamental absurdities of life more clearly than most. my favorite is the trial. i fear, however, that i don't read much fiction, considering truth to not only be more interesting, but often more beautiful as well.  another of my favorite books is james hillman's brilliant and provocative revisioning psychology.  i also love alan watts's books, including his beautifully titled autobiography: \"in my own way.\" in it, he said that his main goals in life were to \"screw the inscrutable and eff the ineffable.\" i couldn't agree more!  my favorite movies are wings of desire and the wizard of oz. that said, i love cinema of many varieties. i lived in new york last year. one of the best parts about being there was becoming a member of moma, which allowed me access to their amazing film program, where, among other things, i saw the opening of winter's bone, with the director and a number of the actors. what an amazing film.  the best thing i've seen lately though is 'the disappearance of alice creed.' truly brilliant, however disturbing.  and of course i'm a great lover of italian cinema, especially fellini, and within his ouvre, the satyricon.  i love a broad range of music. my favorite bands are u2, bruce springsteen, the doors, and more recently dave matthews and the red hot chili peppers. i also love stravinsky's rites of spring and anything by chet baker. i also love a range of world music, both to listen and dance to, from king sunny ade to boca do rio to bunny wailer.  i shouldn't forget peter gabriel and king crimson from the '80s. living in austin in the '80s was a sublime experience. i crave sublime experiences, not to mention a little ecstasy every now and again (not the drug!).  and i just saw linda tillery in berkeley. they were amazing!  hardly, strictly bluegrass was wonderful. i saw five great acts: trombone shorty, the carolina chocolate drops, doc watson (i hope my groove is still working so well at 87!), nick lowe, and the magnificent sharon jones and the dap kings. what a blast!  concerning food, there is a broad range, once again, but i'm completely smitten these days with an indian buffet joint on 9th avenue. i really do love a broad range of cuisines. one of my favorite newish restaurants is a middle eastern place called jannah. it's affordable and delicious, and the owner is a peach of a man. i got spoiled on middle eastern food while living in pasadena though, in particular armenian food. mm, mm. i also have a taste for polish food, but i won't go any further into that now. and also good old jewish deli. living on the upper west side last year with easy access to murray's and to tal's bagels made my experience there all the more memorable.  my sister is one of the great foodie's of all time. she too lives in sf and always has a memorable restaurant to recommend.\ncuddling, good music, good beer, good herb, love and affection. and also my family, who are magnificent!\nlove, history and the mysteries of life. also why things are as they are, and why our current political situation is so disastrous. you would think that after all these years of human civilization, we would have figured out some of the basics by now. and we have the chutzpah to call ourselves 'homo sapiens'; would that it were so! [more latin, sorry!]  as you can probably tell by now, i am a disappointed optimist, a curmudgeon (one of my favorite words!) with a tender heart. nothing makes me happier than to be inspired by my fellow human beings!\nopen to adventure, wanting to have a good meal and either go to a film or go out dancing. when i'm in a relationship, wanting to do that with a partner, all the while being affectionate and engaged.\nthat i am an affection hound!\nyou are a passionate sane engaging attractive woman who wants to have some fun and/or a serious relationship with an unusual, affectionate and intelligent man. it would also be great if you really like massage (giving and receiving) and are an awesome kisser!\n", "essays_len": 10553}, {"age": "no", "status": "single", "sex": "f", "orientation": "straight", "education": "yes", "ethnicity": "white", "income": "-1", "job": "", "location": "san francisco, california", "essay0": "i've had an on and off thing with okcupid for awhile and now i'm looking for someone new.  east coast to best coast a few years ago. i do love it here but i recently saw moonrise kingdom and it did nothing to suppress my feelings of nostalgia for new england... namely... summer and thunderstorms.  boy should like: laughing, bike riding through eucalyptus to sandy respites, navigating cypress to reach beer gardens, lounging in grass, staring at stars, random and new adventures and making out during all previously mentioned activities.  i definitely appreciate a penchant for creating. in my ideal little world, a collaborative partnership would be an awesome thing to find. but in my ideal little world, i'm not looking for a man on this site... sooo... yeah.  i've had some great experiences on my own. but it's really about time i found a cool dude (best friend) with whom to share some life and love. or ya know, maybe even just a cookie for starters.  other things: design, photo, food (bird nest soup? sure!), day or weekend getaways (exploring nature, history, small towns), art (from street to fine), mid century anything, kitsch, flea markets, big ol trucks, big dogs (saint bernard big), skiing (i take names), entertaining (love throwing dinner parties, brunches, etc), dancing (i get down), biking, camping (i never forget the corkscrew), hiking, travelling (can take me anywhere).", "essay1": "creating good design.", "essay2": "+ what i'm doing with my life.  + the dougie.  + building campfires. thank you, girl scouts of america.  + being a thoughtful, generous friend.  + finding fun things to do.

i really enjoy living here and love cities with history, diversity and tons to do. i grew up in the suburbs of san diego and graduated from ucsd with a ba in communications. i've worked in social services and now work in online advertising. i enjoy experiencing the world, but also have the lazy day every now and then in front of the tv. if i can't travel outside of sf, i try and play tourist here, hitting up the museums, theatres, etc.\nwork wise, i work in business development for an online advertising network, and am nocontinuing to learn the industry.  more importantly, i am trying to live life as a cosmopolitan man through worldly intellectualism and expanding my experience of the world through travel, theatre, art, etc., all in a quest to be a good person, a good friend, a good citizen and a good companion.\ni have been told i am really good at listening, and i try to maintain a balance in knowledge about pop culture and current events.  i am also good at organization and planning. some of my friends have called it meticulous - i just like to know where my things are and how to find them quickly.\npeople tend to notice my eyes physically and then i've been told that they notice that i am very grounded.\none of my favorite books is wicked, which also happens to be one of my favorite musicals. i enjoy most of gregory macguire's books.  cinematically, i tend to enjoy musicals on film like hairspray, jesus christ superstar and hair. milk is also on the top of my list.  musically, i pretty much stick to pop and dance; madonna, cher, kylie, lady gaga, scissor sisters, etc.  television wise, i like comedic dramas on tv like glee and desperate housewives. i love good sitcoms like modern family and friends, and just started getting into cougar town and happy endings. i also can't resist cartoon satires like family guy and south park.\ni am not sure i can think of six things i could never do without. i think i would learn to adapt once i lost it, but then again, \"don't know what you've got til it's gone.\"\ni spend a lot of time thinking about the past and the future, for me and society. i think about why things are the way they are in order to understand how to move about them.\non a typical friday night i am with my friends having fun as we all attempt to release the stress of the week. sometimes at a bar, sometimes playing wii. it varies.\nthey say \"a girl's got to have her secrets,\" and i think this applies to guys too.\ni'm looking for new friends and dates in the city. if you are looking for the same and think we may get
