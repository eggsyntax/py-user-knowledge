playing a game of poker.  being a part of a church community is a significant part of my life --- i love the process of doing life within a faith community, as well as the opportunities for service, relationships and transformation which it allows.\n\nhmm...always hard to say. most people have commented on my \"kindness and warmth\" and that i seem welcoming. you'll have to let me know what you think.\nooh..always hard to narrow this down:  books -- anything by henri nouwen, donald miller or shauna niequist, rilke, everything belongs by richard rohr, east of eden, traveling mercies by anne lamott  movies -- painful to admit, but i love a good chick flick, also anything that has to do with travel -- motorcycle diaries, under the tuscan sun, roman holiday; some documentaries  music - ben harper, dave matthews, the weepies, sufjan stevens, joshua radin, mumford and sons, avett brothers, train, sleeping at last, glen philips, brett dennen, the samples, over the rhine, cat stevens,....  food --- love italian, indian, thai ... pretty much anything you could find and cook up from a farmer's market\n1. close friends and family 2. my dog 3. really good coffee -- peets, philz, blue bottle are all fabulous 4. the outdoors -- the mountains and the ocean 5. books that stir my soul 6. a faith community\ni often find myself thinking about things related to psychology, human growth/potential, spirituality..... that and, when i'll get to take my dog for a walk and have a good cup of peet's coffee.\nanything from out for dinner or exploring a city with friends to relaxing with my dog, a glass of wine and a good book.\n\nyou love:  travel exploring things locally and abroad being a part of faith community good coffee being outside -- anywhere hanging out with friends and family\n", "essays_len": 2412}, {"age": "yes", "status": "single", "sex": "f", "orientation": "straight", "education": "", "ethnicity": "", "income": "-1", "job": "banking / financial / real

also i used to perform simple magic tricks during my pick-up-artist phase) a zippo (because lighters always come in handy. always)\nhow much time i've spent procrastinating instead of doing my work. how much beer it would take for me to get hammered drunk (a lot, i'm sure, which is one of the many reasons why i don't drink anymore).\neither at a live show, a movie, a bar or at home, rewatching married with children episodes on netflix.\ni lost my virginity at the ripe age of 22!

[2] connection: in my world, there are five relevant areas in which two people can connect: physical, mental, emotional, spiritual and energetic. all are important for a sustainable long-term intimate relationship. but of course there are different types of relationships, and it sometimes takes a while to figure out what the appropriate type is for the two people involved. indeed, there are more and more complications at every turn. so it goes.  so back to the five levels. two people may well connect on one or more, but to have a sustainable long-term intimate relationship, one needs (or at least i do) to connect on all five. a sign of my maturity, of late, is that i no longer believe that 100% connection on all levels is necessary, but i do think 80% or so on at least most of them is.  but of course people change in both the long and the short term.  anyway, without going on too long here, i hope you get the outline at least of what i'm looking for. i really am open to and hoping to find my life's partner, and to spending the rest of our lives exploring intimacy, connection and joy together in all the relevant ways. wouldn't that be lovely! in the meantime, however, i hope to enjoy the process of finding her, however long that takes.  my main motivating factor in life is to penetrate beneath the surface into the juicy heart of things, thereby inspiring and nourishing everyone i come into contact with. in that light, there is this mysterious dimension called sympathy', electricity', chemistry' or simply energetic connection'. you certainly know it when you feel it; at least i do. and of course that also happens (or can happen) on numerous levels simultaneously, thereby also increasing the complexity of coupling. yipes! why can't things be simple? do you suppose god is jewish too? and that klezmer was the original music of the spheres at creation? (the pythagoreans were so square!)  and speaking of complications, although on some level it seems like it might be fun to be polyamorous, in reality, there is only one thing more complicated that being involved with one woman and that's being involved with more than one!  there you have it, a first approach to articulating my philosophy of relationships. but let there be no doubt: i believe in love and its transformative and redemptive powers. truly, madly, deeply!  i hope you do too.", "essay1": "the main things i'm doing with my life these days are finishing my book on the history of astrology and looking for love. and trying to do as much good and have as much fun as humanly possible.  i am also doing my part to raise a magnificent almost 18 year old daughter who is my pride and joy, the apple of my eye, and a scorpio like her nice old dad. i have learned so much about life (and women!) from getting to know her over the years. every phase has been more wonderful than the last! what a blessing she is, giving me constant hope and faith in an increasingly crazy world.  fyi though, she lives with her mother, not me.  i am also looking for a patron in lieu of the academic position for which i have been searching, mostly in vain. i have, however, had a splendid run of one year jobs and postdoctoral fellowships that have taken me to, among other places, los angeles (the huntington--paradise on earth!) and new york (nyu), cambridge, ma and norman, ok, florence and rome. ah, italy! i have been very fortunate indeed! somehow, if one follows ones bliss, things have a way of working out.  along those lines, i was deeply inspired at a relatively young age by a book called the last barrier by reshad field. he said that the sufis say that our job in this life is to find out our true name (as it were) and to proclaim it every day in every way for the rest of our lives. marsilio ficino says the same thing in his astounding text, the de vita libri tres, especially in the 3rd book, the famous de vita coelitus comparanda (on deriving life from the heavens).

[2] connection: in my world, there are five relevant areas in which two people can connect: physical, mental, emotional, spiritual and energetic. all are important for a sustainable long-term intimate relationship. but of course there are different types of relationships, and it sometimes takes a while to figure out what the appropriate type is for the two people involved. indeed, there are more and more complications at every turn. so it goes.  so back to the five levels. two people may well connect on one or more, but to have a sustainable long-term intimate relationship, one needs (or at least i do) to connect on all five. a sign of my maturity, of late, is that i no longer believe that 100% connection on all levels is necessary, but i do think 80% or so on at least most of them is.  but of course people change in both the long and the short term.  anyway, without going on too long here, i hope you get the outline at least of what i'm looking for. i really am open to and hoping to find my life's partner, and to spending the rest of our lives exploring intimacy, connection and joy together in all the relevant ways. wouldn't that be lovely! in the meantime, however, i hope to enjoy the process of finding her, however long that takes.  my main motivating factor in life is to penetrate beneath the surface into the juicy heart of things, thereby inspiring and nourishing everyone i come into contact with. in that light, there is this mysterious dimension called sympathy', electricity', chemistry' or simply energetic connection'. you certainly know it when you feel it; at least i do. and of course that also happens (or can happen) on numerous levels simultaneously, thereby also increasing the complexity of coupling. yipes! why can't things be simple? do you suppose god is jewish too? and that klezmer was the original music of the spheres at creation? (the pythagoreans were so square!)  and speaking of complications, although on some level it seems like it might be fun to be polyamorous, in reality, there is only one thing more complicated that being involved with one woman and that's being involved with more than one!  there you have it, a first approach to articulating my philosophy of relationships. but let there be no doubt: i believe in love and its transformative and redemptive powers. truly, madly, deeply!  i hope you do too.\nthe main things i'm doing with my life these days are finishing my book on the history of astrology and looking for love. and trying to do as much good and have as much fun as humanly possible.  i am also doing my part to raise a magnificent almost 18 year old daughter who is my pride and joy, the apple of my eye, and a scorpio like her nice old dad. i have learned so much about life (and women!) from getting to know her over the years. every phase has been more wonderful than the last! what a blessing she is, giving me constant hope and faith in an increasingly crazy world.  fyi though, she lives with her mother, not me.  i am also looking for a patron in lieu of the academic position for which i have been searching, mostly in vain. i have, however, had a splendid run of one year jobs and postdoctoral fellowships that have taken me to, among other places, los angeles (the huntington--paradise on earth!) and new york (nyu), cambridge, ma and norman, ok, florence and rome. ah, italy! i have been very fortunate indeed! somehow, if one follows ones bliss, things have a way of working out.  along those lines, i was deeply inspired at a relatively young age by a book called the last barrier by reshad field. he said that the sufis say that our job in this life is to find out our true name (as it were) and to proclaim it every day in every way for the rest of our lives. marsilio ficino says the same thing in his astounding text, the de vita libri tres, especially in the 3rd book, the famous de vita coelitus comparanda (on deriving life from the heavens).

 food!: vegan/vegetarian food. fermented foods are always a favorite. anything but papayas, which to me are the edible equivalent of farts and stinky feet combined.  tv?: right now, downton abbey, sherlock.. i'm pretty bad at watching tv, and tend to have to remind myself to do it.\nsound and silence; avocados, beets, and eggplants; books and libraries; resale shops, dumpsters and free piles; having non-human animal friends; having nasty sex with nice people\nsex, in both a sexy way and a (usually unsexy) theoretical way.  music, in an (always) unsexy theoretical way.\nwondering how i missed the bus, if a bus is going to come, if it will be going in the right direction, and where exactly i am.\nsometimes when i'm home alone i'll sing showtunes at the top of my lungs. for hours.\n- you're working through your shit, recognize that i'm working through my shit, recognize that it's hard for all of us, and are willing to communicate constructively about that stuff! ideally, while also being patient and not-too-militant. - you're interested in sex work, bdsm, and/or radical sexual self-education, and in approaching discussions about/practices of them from vegan, queer, feminist, poc, and/or anarchist perspectives.

(and you also have to be down with latin jams)  food...sigh. fyi. the sf food festival is my favorite!\nfamily (pup juliette included) friends laughter good food travel my contacts (lenses not my iphone peeps)\n...life after grad school.\n...most likely studying, watching a movie or having a glass of wine (or two) with friends. oh, and occasionally i'm shooting zombies on xbox (not too shabby at it - reached level 25). a veces i get to escape from my cave and head to the mission for some dancing and a cold corona.\n...i didn't learn how to ride a bike until i was 18 years old. i think i still struggle.\n...you enjoy taking long walks on the beach...with my dog? :)  ...you are warm, passionate, motivated, down to earth and down to share some fun & laughs. it helps if you like crme brle.

usually stay home and take care of alessa. i'm not much of a party type of girl. if i am out, however, i usually end up either going rock-climbing or just goof off with my two buds.\ni guess you'll

i also think games like taboo and charades are awesome, because they breakdown mental barriers, and let people connect in creative ways! i also have to admit my inclination to play (a select few) computer games. ready, set, go!

 i've also recently picked up writing as a hobby. i've had one of my short stories published in the art magazine at my university so i'm hoping to write some more!\noverexplaining simple matters. listening. using complicated analogies to explain a topic that end up making my point more confusing randomness. cooking! (sometimes) candy..not sure if that's a viable variable to be \"good at\" absurdity. shyness. n64 games. creativity. cats. imagining silly and horrorfying stories and explainations for everyday events. weird dreams. forgetting what i wanted to add to the profile.\nif you can see me then you must be the boy from the sixth sense. *spoiler* because i am actually a ghost.  but.. they would notice that i'm a tad bit on the shy side and i smile a lot whether i like to or not.\ni think the point of favorites is to limit a particular category to a few select interests. so i will try to not just list! hayao miyazaki is my favorite film director. i like most anime i see as well as horror movies and shows such as tales from the crypt and twilight zone. my favorite authors are lovecraft, carl sagan and george r.r. martin. i find cosmic horror deeply entrancing!  for television i really enjoy nat geo, science channel and history channel. my favorite program of those has to be an idiot abroad. for those who've seen it, i have a major man crush on karl. i think he's a pessimistic delight! i like programs that give me something to think about and have a conversation over, whether it be with someone else or myself :p. also i know history channel is a poor example but i like american restoration and pawn stars. i love symphonic metal and my favorite musical band is nightwish.  i also like to listen to cheesy goth music and europop.  candy. i have a massive sweet tooth. i also really like pears.\nskin bound with roughly 70% water and various organs that perform biological functions (ohh i'm so edgy..) imagination running learning humor science cats\ndreams/nightmares, fantastical stories i plan to write down (someday..), clever things to say, problems associated with the world.. and kittens  lately my topic of indulgence has been how to acquire an entire collection of furbies. though do not worry! thoughts like this are only around for a little bit..normally :)\nsolving some sort of apocalyptic mystery.. or not doing much d:  last friday i decided to create the entire season 6 cast of boy meets world on nintendo wii. as the little mii characters. so evidently i'm very busy on the weekends\ni am dreadfully sane despite what others may think.\nyou're kind, maybe a tad shy. you love imagination and can accept someone who has a tendency to be offbeat! you like to overexplain. you're awkward. need a good friend. you would rather go to scotland than the island kingdom of tonga. i am very kind and shy myself; but accepting. so please don't

the answer is sadly yes. i think a person with lower self esteem would feel compelled to prove how not self centered they are (read the gift of fear!). but it doesn't work on me. also, i'm pretty self centered, but that's besides the point.  \"i only score a 4, but...\"  -how many times a week do i get this? every other day? 1) i'm probably not interested. while having an accent may not be a deal breaker, most of the things on the list are important to me. i don't want to date an ugly dumb republican, for example. 2) it's seems so self defeating. nowhere do i say \"i must know your score.\" if you want to go for a long shot and message me, why include the fact that you failed my \"message me if\" in your first message? i guess it's a boon to me, since it makes it easier to screen out the people i don't want to go on a date with.  \"only 4.5 out of 6\"  - i had to include this message, because there are so many things wrong with it. 1) .5? so many people do this and it drives me nuts. you don't get half a point for almost having an accent or almost being well endowed, or almost preferring open relationships. 2) poor grammar. 3) there are 7 available points.  \"how do i tell if im well endowed?\"  -the bad grammar alone is a turn off. but to answer this boy's question, you could measure and compare yourself to the general population, length and width. but probably if you have to ask, that means you aren't.  \"i want to suck your pussy until you cum on my face.\"  -while i like sex, i tend to get very turned off by messages that are explicitly sexual. i think it's very presumptuous. just because i like sex does not automatically mean that i wish to have sex with you. meeting for a few drinks to get to know each other is a good start on the road to getting in my pants, but if the chemistry's not there it just won't happen. also, this particular message (from a man) arrogantly presumes he already knows how to pleasure me. perhaps all pussies are the same to him?

this is probably the cruelest message i've received. it assumes 1) i don't like sex. not sure why this person would make that assumption about anyone. perhaps he's a misogynist that believes women never like sex, they only let men have sex with them to please them? 2) i need to be someone i'm not to make people like me.  \"hi, i messaging you because i wanted to despite not reading everything on your profile.\" - huh?", "essay": "i live in san francisco. i write a sex toy blog (http://labyrinthwomb.blogspot.com). i'm a recent college graduate with a degree in drama. i love acting and theater history. and world history. and sexuality. actually, i just like knowing things and being right. ;)  i have a boyfriend. he's amazing. but occasionally i'll go out with a boy who isn't him. if i really like someone, i may ask them to join us in a threesome. i like those.  according to the myers-briggs personality test i'm an istj.  awards: kyle_dont_surf gave me: the perfect mix awarded may 14 even though her uterus in maze-like, labryinthwomb is one of the coolest people i've met off okc. smart, fun to hang out with, kicks ass at battle ship, and looks good in a mustache to boot.   bawear gave me: shroud of mystery awarded jun 18 just when you think you've figured this one out, she will most definitely shock your striped, expensive hipster socks off. give a ring around the rosie.   superlatomcat gave me: friends in real life awarded oct 3 she is the one who finally got me to join okc! believe me i was stubborn about it. she's also the one who taught me how to knit, which is my new favorite hobby.  subcortex gave me: the perfect mix awarded nov 13 don't let the adorable girl-next-door smile fool you, labyrinthwomb knows exactly what she wants, and knows exactly how to get it. and she makes people feel fantastic about it along the way. she's pure awesome.\nvolunteering. i've found it's a lot easier to find things to do that don't pay than to find a job.  besides that, nothing. anyone have a job for me?

(the british isles, australia, new zealand, south africa, france, and rural georgia and louisiana are my special favorites!) (1)  *** messages that make me uninterested:  these are real messages from boys and girls i do not want to date. to clarify, these are all the first message given to me. this section will probably alienate a lot of people who will consider me bitchy. in that case this is probably good to put up because only those who can appreciate my dry, schadenfreude-esque humor and disregard for stranger's feelings will message me, and we will be more likely to get along. ^.^  \"i'm curious if you are a bit self centered.\"  -do insults usually help get the girl? the answer is sadly yes. i think a person with lower self esteem would feel compelled to prove how not self centered they are (read the gift of fear!). but it doesn't work on me. also, i'm pretty self centered, but that's besides the point.  \"i only score a 4, but...\"  -how many times a week do i get this? every other day? 1) i'm probably not interested. while having an accent may not be a deal breaker, most of the things on the list are important to me. i don't want to date an ugly dumb republican, for example. 2) it's seems so self defeating. nowhere do i say \"i must know your score.\" if you want to go for a long shot and message me, why include the fact that you failed my \"message me if\" in your first message? i guess it's a boon to me, since it makes it easier to screen out the people i don't want to go on a date with.  \"only 4.5 out of 6\"  - i had to include this message, because there are so many things wrong with it. 1) .5? so many people do this and it drives me nuts. you don't get half a point for almost having an accent or almost being well endowed, or almost preferring open relationships. 2) poor grammar. 3) there are 7 available points.  \"how do i tell if im well endowed?\"  -the bad grammar alone is a turn off. but to answer this boy's question, you could measure and compare yourself to the general population, length and width. but probably if you have to ask, that means you aren't.  \"i want to suck your pussy until you cum on my face.\"  -while i like sex, i tend to get very turned off by messages that are explicitly sexual. i think it's very presumptuous. just because i like sex does not automatically mean that i wish to have sex with you. meeting for a few drinks to get to know each other is a good start on the road to getting in my pants, but if the chemistry's not there it just won't happen. also, this particular message (from a man) arrogantly presumes he already knows how to pleasure me. perhaps all pussies are the same to him?  \"i bet your over-sexed facade gets you lot's of messages.\"  -is this a come on? did you message me because you want a date, or just to be mean? if the former, does this technique ever work? if the latter, why? this is

(not to mention, i love the food!)  until last year, i had never traveled alone. i'm happy to report that i now really love it, though there's a lot to be said for shared memories.  i love to skip.  i admire people who can do things i can't.\nwriting is not only what i do, it's the prism though which i often see the world. i think evelyn waugh, e.m. forster, and milan kundera are geniuses. it took me a long time to allow myself to write because i knew i'd never be able to write like them.  before deciding to move back here from la and attempt to write my first novel, i worked in film production and aspired to become a filmmaker. i hope to return to that first love someday, but am currently enjoying a \"normal\" life working in the wine industry far from tinsel town.\ni'm generally good at making people feel at ease and included. i like to surround myself with people from different backgrounds and with varied interests. i'd like to think that i'm accepting of people and supportive. my friends consider me a good listener and insightful.  am in the process of rediscovering san francisco with a visitor's eye. after a trip to england last year, i became trigger happy with my new camera, and am always on the look-out for interesting shots--in this city, i'm like a kid in a candy store.  i love to sing and dance for my own enjoyment, not (usually) for an audience, and enjoy exploring the richness of the english language.  i'm fairly willing to try new things and explore but am not a dare devil--i value my good judgement.\ni suppose it's my warmth and calmness. i don't pretend that they're always there for all to see, but those seem to be the most frequently commented upon.  oh, and my hair. my friends can always spot me in a crowd.\nhowards end, brideshead revisited and the unbearable lightness of being top my book list, as well as the art of the novel by kundera. am making an effort to read more contemporary works (loved atonement), especially non-fiction.  my movie list is more varied, including the social network, the last king of scotland, his girl friday, heavenly creatures, letter to an unknown woman, fight club, the third man, the insider, reds, vertigo, un coeur en hiver, starter for 10, wuthering heights, a room with a view, and a handful of dust. that seems like a pretty serious list, but i do love comedies and adventures, too.  my music preference is decidedly alternative: muse, arcade fire, pixies, squeeze, swell season, classic u2.... i also enjoy classical, scottish fiddle, opera, some musical theater (not \"annie\"!), and the occasional blues or hip hop track.  as for food, i love all asian cuisines, moroccan/algerian, mediterranean/italian, traditional british fare like cottage pies and fish & chips, and brazilian/cuban. but am really open to trying almost anything, except for insects and anything that still has a pulse.\nmy friends and family my cat my car (or any personal means of transport/travel) a pen and lots of paper my favorite books and movies a sense of humor and compassion\nthe short answer is exploring and understanding the world around me. even if i wasn't a writer, i would be fascinated by what motivates people (including myself), what makes things tick, what forces converge to create history. travelling and exploring aren't enough. beyond them both is the adventure within, the one that leads to real understanding, compassion and, ultimately, change. sometimes the change is subtle, barely perceptible. sometimes it's a big bang. either way, it's exciting.  (re-reading my answer, it sounds a bit touchy-feely, and that's not really my personality. i tend to think of myself as diplomatically direct.)  in the last couple of years, i've become more involved in animal welfare causes and now volunteer at the local animal shelter socializing cats and kittens in preparation for adoption. it normally takes a lot to get me to cry (except when watching sappy movies), but if i see an animal in distress, i get mad first and then teary and then mad again. while i'm normally a very calm person, that is one thing that will get my blood boiling, so while i do spend quite a bit of time noand thinking about animal causes, i try not to overdo it.\ni generally spend time with friends having dinner, seeing movies/plays/concerts, going for walks, going dancing, or setting off on road trips (though, sadly, not enough).  i recently rediscovered the joys of dancing, particularly scottish country and highland dancing. i enjoy the energy and precision, as well as the performance and social aspects. i've tried my hand at swing/lindy hop and waltz, and next am going to tackle bollywood!\non occasion, my sense of irony has caused a little misunderstanding. i do enjoy occasionally being mischievous and playing around with people's expectations.  my resolution last year was to do the opposite of what i would normally do when faced with taking a risk. (if this sounds familiar it's because it was in part inspired by an episode of seinfeld.) it was one of the most interesting years in memory!\n...if you are kind, warm, genuine, and curious about the world. above all, you must have compassion. i've come to realize it requires a high level of understanding of one's own frailties and an emotional understanding of others. it takes guts and it takes work.

(i know. that's one more than six! does that bother you?)\njust ask me. i spend a lot of time thinking about a lot of different things. sometimes i even think about thinking, or how to not think. :)\ncaring for my son, and visiting friends, novideo game level designs, graphic designs, 3d models, analyzing/playing video games (to figure out why some elements work well, and what doesn't). thinking about sex, and my girlfriend, who is primary, and slave.\ni am pretty much an open book. if you want to know the answer, just ask. i'll answer honestly. i love touching people. (i even hug my male friends! \"eeew!\" lol!) i am a very sensual person. i have a kinky side, and am in a poly relationship.\ni sound like someone you would like to know better. you feel the need to. the voices told you to. lol! (or, if you happen to be the number 0 (not a 0, just the number), i also like ninja bunnies, but i can never seem to find any... i guess that's because they are ninjas...)  i can also be found on fetlife as ashigeru http://fetlife.com/users/247549\n", "essays_len": 5558}, {"age": "yes", "status": "single", "sex": "m", "orientation": "straight", "education": "no", "ethnicity": "hispanic / latin", "income": "40000", "job": "other", "location": "san francisco, california", "essay0": "so i know this is not a great pic of me but i promise i am much cuter.i posted this pic with my phone. my first smart phone actually and i cant figure out how to get it to zoom out. sometimes i feel like i am analog signal in a digital world. i am a hopeless romantic. you know i occasionally. check out craigslist ads for someone who wants a relationship. i realized most of those ads are spam. so i joined this site thinking i wouldnt run it fake ads and spam. women claim to want someone who is not a flake or a religious cheater. someone who can hold a concversation and can dress himself and fit in with more than just the homies from the block. someone respectoable and intelligent. someone who has a job and looking for a long term relationship. well thats me . but i want to start as friends first take things slow, the best relationships are the ones based on a great friendship. and no i'm not desperate for a relationship but it would be nice to settle down as i get older. so read my profile. i dont do drugs or drink. i am a recovering alcholic with about 2 yrs sobriety. i am not into games and i'm to old to be bulshitting. what i want is true love. so i dont care if you are rich with a trust fund or poor and work at walgreens or mcdondalds. i have a job that i'm good at and i make good money doing it. so i'm not looking to sponge of anyone. i believe in 50-50 relationship where your opinion matters just as much as mine. i am not looking to play games or fwb, my mind and my heart are open to the possiblities of the future with someone.", "essay1": "i am enjoying my new found sobriety. awakening for the first time in a long time to th world around me. i have come to realize that i have missed so much and now i want to explore and go on new adventures. so thats what brings me to this site because i want to find someone to do these things with. and i have found that dating in this city is really hard.", "essay2": "i am a writer. i love to write. i am good with my hands and can build and design many things .recently built some shelves for my friend using my own design. simple of course. but i am really good at using my imagination for my many creative ways of looking at things and situations.i am really good at accomplishing anything i put my mind to.", "essay3": "that i am a walking wikipedia of random facts and tidbits of knowledge. they tend to notice the fact that despite the fact i don't have a college degree i am very intelligent and knowledgeable about a great many things. i'm personable, caring, optimistic,creative, cute, good looking charming, and passionate. that if i am hanging out with someone or if they see me with someone its almost always a beautiful woman (i have a lot of platonic female friends)........

i am and what i am looking for.  probably the first thing you'd notice about me is my accent and eclecticism. my friends tell me i'm loyal, passionate and affectionate. i'll admit it's tough to hide when i'm excited about life. so i'm looking for someone to help expose the lost intimacies in the world - that's a ridiculously corny, yet true statement. i typically enjoy spending time with women who are just comfortable with themselves, direct, smart and confidently affectionate. i have a good time, join me.  started as an art (studio) major, ended up on international business, and my work lets me have constant interaction with people all over the world. i've studied four languages, lived and worked in three countries, and love to travel to places where i can leave the cellphone behind. i'm an early morning workout guy, which is great because i enjoy a good evening burger (join me on my never-ending quest for the best burger in sf!).  movies and photography are my fall backs. come with me to a matinee, or crank the surround sound movie at home, and then shoot some stills with me in the city and that's a good day.  fun fact: i recently realized i keep 8 different types of hot sauce in the pantry, and no less than 4 different types of icecream in the freezer.\n\n\n\n\nmy camera. pandora/my ipod. good food.\nwhat makes people tick. mid-century furniture. i'm a bit obsessed

arts, the great outdoors, food, great wines, knee deep powder to ski, strong winds in warm waters to kitesurf, anything french and bbc radio 4.  add to that list holding down my current job, at a start up, planning my next venture and getting ready for ski season that sgould give you a good idea of the pace i'm maintaining.  the year to come will be if nothing else interesting.\ni push the marketing team at sol republic. we just launched our line of headphones last august.\nmaking dinner out of random ingredients in the fridge, making the best of things, enjoying people and simple

craftsmanship", "location": "san francisco, california", "essay0": "i am the oldest of 9 that's basically a crazy bastard version of the brady bunch. i am super close with all my sibs and parents. i was born in memphis and my dad met elvis. i grew up in waukesha wis. where i had the freedom to embark on adventures that would make parents today pass out from fear and anxiety. and although i have worked hard to semi eradicate my straight white boy roots, i have maintained my midwestern values. i did a 10 year stint in sw louisiana where i experienced major cultural shock followed by transformative assimilation. i gained a modicum of rhythm two stepping in honky tonks, a love of all things spicy and i owned a fighting cock for a couple of weeks. i built log cabins high in the colorado rockies using mostly hand tools and a clydesdale. i abandoned my overt hippyness in a cave somewhere above aspen. then i moved here and spent many a night in gay dance clubs where i picked up great dance moves and helpful fashion tips. i still love to go dancing, to whatever is on the turn table. i call my style \"homo hipster\" cuz it sounds catchy and gives me lots of fun options for an old straight white guy.  i'm a pretty hyper active kind of a guy who would rather stand than sit. i'm in great shape from playing outside on things with wheels that i have to make go and climbing around on stuff that my mother always tells me to get down off of before i get hurt. i have ridiculous energy. i am way more hipster than yuppie. i like the mission more than the marina. and i think men who drive hummers have issues with the size of their penises. i drive a minivan.  i can build stuff, fix shit and look pretty damn sexy in a wife beater and tool belt. i'm the hoopty king and can definitely give macgyver a run for his money. i can take an old thrift store piece of junk bicycle, build you a sweet townie and teach you to zoom through traffic without getting whacked. i have put on an outlaw bike race series here city parks for 15 years. it's called the urban outlaw cyclo-cross-dress series if you wear a dress you race for free because i love irony. i was a bike messenger for fun between corporate jobs. my tribe generally runs from mid thirties to early forties. i still hang with the same people i met 25 years ago when i moved here. i also ride and own motor cycles. i love design and architecture, especially modern or mid-century. and i own a great flat here in the city that i really enjoy transforming.  i run my own construction management business but i have an agreement with my friend that if he ever catches me in a pair of pleated kaki dockers, he'll cut my legs off. i was previously a construction manager to the really stupid rich. now i work mostly with non-profits building stuff like youth centers and reclaiming forgotten inner city parks. i am very passionate about my work, even though it can be stressful. i even have some mad farmer skills which i can demonstrate with my backyard vegetable boxes and the shade garden i recently planted.  i have a very active, sometimes dark and completely irreverent sense of humor. it runs in the family. but it's never mean spirited, unless i am in good company. i am constantly laughing my stupid ass off. for the eehors of the world, it can be a little disconcerting at times. needless to say i do not take myself too seriously.  i approach almost everything in my life as an opportunity for creativity whether it be clothing or building a bicycle. i fashion \"art\" light fixtures out of weird stuff. and i have few things around my house i've done and i call art. i always have some art project kicking around in my head. and i really would like to hang out with someone that wants to create things together or do projects.  i am afraid to go through the caldecott tunnel. i don't want to be captured by the republicans and made to patrol the boarder. i'm extremely house trained and learned way

basically a crazy bastard version of the brady bunch. i am super close with all my sibs and parents. i was born in memphis and my dad met elvis. i grew up in waukesha wis. where i had the freedom to embark on adventures that would make parents today pass out from fear and anxiety. and although i have worked hard to semi eradicate my straight white boy roots, i have maintained my midwestern values. i did a 10 year stint in sw louisiana where i experienced major cultural shock followed by transformative assimilation. i gained a modicum of rhythm two stepping in honky tonks, a love of all things spicy and i owned a fighting cock for a couple of weeks. i built log cabins high in the colorado rockies using mostly hand tools and a clydesdale. i abandoned my overt hippyness in a cave somewhere above aspen. then i moved here and spent many a night in gay dance clubs where i picked up great dance moves and helpful fashion tips. i still love to go dancing, to whatever is on the turn table. i call my style \"homo hipster\" cuz it sounds catchy and gives me lots of fun options for an old straight white guy.  i'm a pretty hyper active kind of a guy who would rather stand than sit. i'm in great shape from playing outside on things with wheels that i have to make go and climbing around on stuff that my mother always tells me to get down off of before i get hurt. i have ridiculous energy. i am way more hipster than yuppie. i like the mission more than the marina. and i think men who drive hummers have issues with the size of their penises. i drive a minivan.  i can build stuff, fix shit and look pretty damn sexy in a wife beater and tool belt. i'm the hoopty king and can definitely give macgyver a run for his money. i can take an old thrift store piece of junk bicycle, build you a sweet townie and teach you to zoom through traffic without getting whacked. i have put on an outlaw bike race series here city parks for 15 years. it's called the urban outlaw cyclo-cross-dress series if you wear a dress you race for free because i love irony. i was a bike messenger for fun between corporate jobs. my tribe generally runs from mid thirties to early forties. i still hang with the same people i met 25 years ago when i moved here. i also ride and own motor cycles. i love design and architecture, especially modern or mid-century. and i own a great flat here in the city that i really enjoy transforming.  i run my own construction management business but i have an agreement with my friend that if he ever catches me in a pair of pleated kaki dockers, he'll cut my legs off. i was previously a construction manager to the really stupid rich. now i work mostly with non-profits building stuff like youth centers and reclaiming forgotten inner city parks. i am very passionate about my work, even though it can be stressful. i even have some mad farmer skills which i can demonstrate with my backyard vegetable boxes and the shade garden i recently planted.  i have a very active, sometimes dark and completely irreverent sense of humor. it runs in the family. but it's never mean spirited, unless i am in good company. i am constantly laughing my stupid ass off. for the eehors of the world, it can be a little disconcerting at times. needless to say i do not take myself too seriously.  i approach almost everything in my life as an opportunity for creativity whether it be clothing or building a bicycle. i fashion \"art\" light fixtures out of weird stuff. and i have few things around my house i've done and i call art. i always have some art project kicking around in my head. and i really would like to hang out with someone that wants to create things together or do projects.  i am afraid to go through the caldecott tunnel. i don't want to be captured by the republicans and made to patrol the boarder. i'm extremely house trained and learned way more in couples counseling than \"put down the toilet seat\". i was raised by southern parents so i am socially engaging and have great manners that tend to veil my urban edge.

strong idea of what i want to do for a career so for now im taking digital photography classes at the community college known berkeley city college(bcc) in downtown berkeley. i was majoring in american sign language and had hoped to become an interpreter but doing that for a living is a lot of work and its very difficult and im fearful that might not be what i want or am ment to be doing with my life. its typical of people in my age range at this time to really not know what they want to do and with the economy being what it is there is a lot of uncertainty about what to do. some students are spending thousands on degrees that will be worthless the day they graduate. so im pursuing a liberal arts major which means you do a bit of everything. the thing i hate the most about being gay is that for most of the gay community it seems to all be about sex and has nothing to do with finding a relationship with a single person or something consistant and safe. instead its like people are trying to fuck each other over at every turn many people in the gay community lacking any form of unity when it comes to treating each other with basic human decency and respect this seems to especially be the case for san francisco. i dont own a car and dont plan to own one any time in the near future as i've decided to rely on sustainable forms of public transit such as bicycling, trains and buses. mass transit is efficient and it would have been really great if general motors hadn't destroyed the efficient public transportation options that existed in the 1940's in the us and

=)\nliving life one day at a time. broadening my horizons by visiting new places in the bay area and learning their history. im currently noa degree in multimedia arts for now. going out to bay area events and taking tons of photos( recently shot bay to breakers). playing video games every now and then. trying to play catch-up for the 3 years i was totally out of the loop. riding public transportation and enjoying the views and the experience that comes with it. bicycling around the east bay enjoying the beautiful resources the bay area shines with, the bay birds flying by cars zipping along i580. i'm not entirely sure where ill go or what ill end up doing but i hope its beautiful and rewarding.\nphotography, communication, computers, sign language technology growing things, gardening bay area transit public transit bicycling videography history of the bay area understanding highway and freeway networks as well as the us interstates , state routes and bridges making youtube videos  being at the right place at the right time and capturing a video of something terrible like a bus crash or an open door train on muni, or a muni driver smoking inside of a muni train collecting things video editing sound editing finding deals and saving money taking lots of showers helping others learning about specific topics that interest me self advocating  standing up for whats right and not letting people put me or others down rushing procrastinating sign language editing photos keeping up with current events\nim usually pretty happy and all smiles. i'm polite and able to relatable to a wide range of topics. my eyes are blue.\nas far as books go i dont have favorites necessarily here are some books ive read in the past and some i really like, dont laugh!

i'm from the bay area, lived in nyc for six years, brussels for a year, and beirut for two. but the left coast will always be my home. i spend a lot of time outside--bicycling, open water swimming, playing soccer, and doing a few triathlons every year, hiking, practicing kite surfing. i have an urban garden which makes it possible for me to cook with awesome produce in the city.  i've known my five closest friends since pre-school (yep, you read that right) and despite being scattered around the country whenever we're together things can sometimes get ridiculous. what does that mean for you? i'm as loyal as one can be and am generous with those i'm closest.  i've never had a cavity.  as far as the person i'm looking for... you have something you're passionate about and confidence to express your creativity. it doesn't really matter what exactly, but it says something about the intensity with which you live. i want to share experiences and spend time together but also know that it's important for you to have time to yourself. and i hope you can find humor throughout your life and mine.  i would love to be with someone who enjoys trying new foods, listening to live music of all types, learning about and exploring the world, taking some risks in her life, and wants to become as close to my family as i do hers.\ni'm serious about my work, yet make sure that it doesn't consume my life. the way i see it, i need to live fully in the present as much as plan for the future.  i heard this recently (perhaps you know the source), and thought i'd share it since it seems to

instance, i respect time and timing, and have learned to play with them quite well while keeping peoples schedules and positive experiences flowing. in the money earning context, this equated to large and consistent tips, in the flirting context, lots of laughter and mirth and in the dating realm lots of great .... relationships!  ha! you probably thought i was going to say sex. which is awesome, but its not really all that i am after at this stage in my life. i think sex is pretty much a given in this day and age and pretty darned easy if one were to have loose standards or let their hormones run wild. so in a weird way, there is a leveling of the playing field between men and women in regards to sex.  what i am most interested in is, finding a partner that is passionate about co-creating a relationship that works. one that is based on trust, passion, compassion, forgiveness and of course fun. these, i think, are learned skills and are more of a practice than a personality trait.  since i left that beautiful ski town, i have been very involved in learning who i am as a person and figuring out what works/doesn't work and being responsible for being the best me that i can be. its been very transformative, challenging, inspiring, healing and fun. especially, since i have been able to travel, create and express myself in ways i never imagined.  now that i moved to san fransisco, i feel like i have a clean slate to build my new life, make new friends and grow that special relationship into a life together.  writing a profile is weird for me because i am conditioned to get to know people in person in a taxi or other non-significant context. more importantly i had to learn how to break the ice with them instantly so that we would both be comfortable with being in the same vehicle together.  imagine for yourself the social challenges and boundary issues of having strange people in your own car. how good would your judge of character be after thousands of opportunities

partner makes me more capable at accomplishing the goals that i have set out for myself personally, which includes having a healthy, strong relationship. now i am not perfect and relationships do take a certain amount of effort, but i do know that love is a skill and its my responsibility to transform myself to be the best lover that i can be. this however requires good communication on both our parts. to this end i am committed to what works for us as a couple and in particular finding ways to synchronize our lives to be more synergistic. i have found that play, dance, singing and humor are a great place to start but the real magic occurs when we are safe enough to be vulnerable. i know its scary but i can't imagine a life without it and i want to have that with my mate.  it feels

http://www.facebook.com/dartn2  http://messenger.yahoo.com/  i'm looking for a long term relationship. someone to love me unconditionally. if you're not willing to take a chance on me and open your heart to me then don't bother writing. loving someone isn't hard. all you have to do is do it. people make up a lot of bullshit excuses why they can't. they are incapable of love. they can love a cat but not a person. it's sad. noone is perfect. you have to love a person with all their flaws and everything. you have to open your heart and take a chance on love or you will be alone and continue to make excuses why you haven't met the perfect guy. \"he doesn't match my check list, we have nothing in common.\" these things don't matter. all that matters is two people willing to give eachother a chance and love eachother.  i'm looking for someone that can come over often. or if they live close i could come see them.  i love my cat. i like watching tv. i like video games. i like talking to people on irc chat. i'm smart, kind, and down to earth. i'm probably the most accepting guy you'll ever meet. i believe everyone should be treated equally. i don't judge anyone. i treat everyone with respect. i like people to be honest and themselves. theres no point in just being like everyone else. i used to be a singer in rock bands so i like to sing. karaoke is fun cause they appreciate anyone whos halfway decent. i have a purple belt in shito-ryu karate. i like tennis, bowling, pool, swimming, the beach, board games, card games, and fishing. i am originally from the boston area.  who i'd like to meet: someone who likes me for me, has a heart of gold, a great personality, is giving, nice, beautiful inside and out, understanding, non-judgemental, down to earth, someone who is like me, honest, someone i can be myself around, someone i can say anything to, someone who is ok with a skinny guy, someone not superficial or materialistic, someone who is patient, someone who wants to get to know me, someone who wants to be my friend.  music alternative, rock. judybats, bettie serveert, dramarama, tori amos, liz phair, aimee mann, ben folds five, weezer, radiohead, 80s, 90s, grunge,

self-aware, kind and adventurous guy who has been a single, devoted parent to two wonderful kids for over a decade. with both of them starting college in the fall, my parenting duties are now dissipating. i seek a jewish woman who is both proud and curious about her identity, who is loving and outgoing, who lives nearby and who has the time and willingness to love, explore and build a magnificent relationship with me.  i am looking for someone with a \"sunny personality,\" someone who smiles a lot, who is outgoing and friendly with others, who is warm and nurturing, and who is very comfortable in her own skin.  curiosity about many things including the world of ideas, current events, and nature are all interests i treasure in myself and i highly admire in others.  i would love to find someone who enjoys living a compassionate and health-conscious lifestyle, and finds meaning in life that includes being of service to others.  i deeply enjoy the simple, healthy and meaningful pleasures of life and want to share them each day with someone very special. thank you for your interest.\ni have married, divorced, and successfully raised both a son and daughter. i have been a devoted father and son. to a lesser extent i am fortunate to continue in these roles today.  at this time i am balancing work (i run my own business) with beginning the process finding romance and attraction combined with shared interests, admiration, devotion and deep friendship.\ncommunication and relationship matters. sincere, meaningful discussions about the things that matter in life.\ni'm

direct questions! i do well with nature and adventure, poorly with work attitude, excel with rationality and empathy, appreciate good people, have in-your-face desires with bad people, do chef stuff in the kitchen, fix most anything, geek out, read too many books too quickly, stay up and sleep late whenever possible, stay healthy, relish relaxation, confront challenges, resist hypocrisy, solve problems, listen carefully, spell poorly, and drive well.  here's a little ditty i ran across a few years ago. i like it, it makes sense, and i hope you like it also. let me know. no, i don't think you have crabs. and, if you take this seriously or think this is obnoxious, then please consider humor replacement therapy.  a guide to talking to women in bars and other things  before we begin, let's consider two basic points about women's (a) needs and (b) communication styles.  first, (a) women's needs:   women need security and women need to feel attractive. they need it, like men need approval. no psychobabble, it's just true.  secondly, (b) women's communication styles:   men communicate by demonstrating their accomplishments. this demonstrates their prowess and garners approval. listen to men talk: sports stats, their knowledge of movies, music, politics, their possessions, i did this, i did that, etc.,   women communicate to establish intimacy. i'm not sure why, cause i'm not a woman, but it's true. listen to them talk. they give all these details that seem so irrelevant. this is what i was wearing, and then janine said... and every guy wants to yell, get to the fuckin' point!! however, these details are not irrelevant to them. they are attempting to establish intimacy. so listen or at least look like you're listening. it's not important to a woman that her story is important to you. it's important that she feels like you know it's important to her.  please remember these two points: (a) women need security and they need to feel attractive and (b) they communicate to establish intimacy. this is as much a part of women as a strong pitching staff is to the new york yankees. curb your own communication style toward these two points and you will prosper. ignore these two points at your own risk.  okay, let's begin.  first off, don't use lines. can i buy you a drink? do you have the time? are those space-pants? cause your ass is out of this world! lines are stupid. you're a stud, you don't need lines.  be yourself. if you are a loud, funny, crazy guy, go with that. if you are shy and quiet, go with that. the more comfortable you are the better off you are.  now, go to the bar with a group of friends. you have strength and numbers, you show that you have a life, plus you need to take a wingman if you're going to talk to a woman who is not alone.  now, when you see the girl of choice, try to make a little eye contact, if you can. she's already noticed every guy in the place, just like you've noticed every cute girl. don't stand by, staring and drooling, if you she doesn't notice you after a short while (about the amount of time it takes you to slowly and calmly finish your drink), go over to her.  now, before you do, you must say these words to yourself and you must believe them 100%. i don't need this woman, and if i get shot down, so what, she probably has crabs.  try it now, just to yourself (make sure your co-workers/roommates aren't watching), i don't need this women, and if i get shot down, so what, she probably has crabs.  try it again, i don't need this women, and if i get shot down, so what, she probably has crabs.  and believe it. whether or not some chick in a bar likes you is meaningless. if she rejects you, it is completely inconsequential in the grand scheme of your life. you're a stud, trust me.  now, walk up to her and say, hi. i'm insert your name.' (shake her hand firmly, but don't be brutish; you probably outweigh her by fifty pounds). either she will say, so. or she will say, hi, i'm insert her name.' if she says, so, or anything comparable, shrug and walk away. she probably has crabs.  okay, so she tells you her name. now what? if she has a boring name (e.g. jen, maria, karen) don't say, wow, what a great name! but if her name is exotic, (margarita, ezmerelda, charlie), give her a very laid back comment. great name or that's pretty. don't gush. every other guy gushes. just a simple compliment will do.  if she has crazy hair or shiny blue eyes or some feature that looks like every guy has commented on it, don't say anything. please. if all goes well, you'll have plenty of time to compliment them another time.  now say, ezmerelda, how are you doing, tonight? sounds simple right? it is.  are you having a good night? if she says no, say, oh, that's too bad, i hope your night gets better. it was nice meeting you. cheers. leave. you do not need to get mixed up with someone like that. she either wants to be left alone or she's looking for pity. you don't need any pity cases, especially, pity cases with crabs. (no, she doesn't have actual crabs. it's a metaphor and if you haven't figured that out by now, then you probably have crabs.) :-)  if she says, yes, then you're in  here's how simple it is. here's how you talk to women, right here, right now...  you say, great. me too. my buddies and i are just kicking back after a great day of ____________.  (of course, you actually need to do something with your life.) (if all you do is play video games or watch movies or wrestle your monkey, you're fucked. you need more help then i can give.)  so what do you do with your life, stud? if you do outdoor stuff, say, after a great day of hiking. do you go to the beach? after a great day at the beach. hell, did you go out for lunch? say, after a great, laid back saturday. the idea is that you did something. and whatever you did, it was great. you are someone who enjoys life, you are setting the stage for intimacy and you are offering an emotion: enjoyment.  now here's the catch, she already knows whether you've got a shot. if you've gotten this far, she will either respond one of two ways. she will either respond with enthusiasm or she will not.  if she responds with enthusiasm (i.e., by asking questions), describe your day with the same degree of enthusiasm. if she is psyched, you be psyched. if she is mellow, you be mellow. then before you exhaust the topic, you switch gears. you ask her how her weekend, day, whatever, is going. if she volunteers the info, great, she's talking and beginning her own establishment of intimacy. and as we all know, that's what she needs.  (if she is not enthusiastic or interested, then she is not interested. at this point, say well, it was nice to meet you, excuse yourself, walk away, she probably has crabs, etc.)  i know it sounds trite, but what i really dislike about some people (not just women) is when they fail to ask questions and just talk about themselves.  keep her talking, ask her question and after question after question. don't talk about yourself. nothing is as boring to a woman as you. if she wants to know about you, she will ask. the only time you talk, besides asking the questions, is to relate a comparable story. but at this point, you direct the conversation by asking her questions and letting her establish intimacy.  if the conversation starts to stagnate, here are some basic questions to remember?  1. what kind of music do you like? a favorite artist/group? 2. are you from this area originally? 3. what kind of movies are you into? a favorite kind of movie? favorite movie? 4. what do you do for a living? 5. hobbies? 6. family? 7. do you travel? where would you go, if you could?*  *(number 7 is especially good. all women love travel and all women love fantasy. where would you go? is super. of course, don't use number 7 right away. build up to it and then, bang!)  now, you have to close the deal. when it feels right, say, let's get together some time. don't ask her. tell her. it's more natural. and she will like the confidence. if she especially liked you opener, ask her if she would like to join you the next time you're going to do it. or just ask her out to dinner. or a night on the town or the theatre or jesus, anything you and she would enjoy together.  (don't suggest anything for a first date that you don't want to do. the ballet will most likely bore the pants off of you. you'll get irritated, you'll get anxious and your first date will be your last. go to the park or have a picnic or something mutually enjoyable.)  great, let me have your phone number and i'll give you a call. that's it. you're done. now, if you say you are going to call, then call. women hate liars like every other team hates the world champion new york yankees.  so to recap:  1. be yourself. 2. hi, 3. how are you? 4. great, i (me and my buddies) are just kicking back after a great day of 5. questions, questions, questions 6. let's get together  and remember those seventeen magic words, \"i don't need this woman, and if i get shot down, so what, she probably has crabs.\"  so, there you go. that's how you talk to women. good luck.  p.s. to all you women reading this, i know there will be some, stop with the fucking expectations and self-deprecation in you ads.  1. if love is gonna happen, it will happen. you can't force it, no matter how loud your biological clock is ticking. meet the guy. talk to him. see what happens.  2. fat chick looking for love so what, i'm not a supermodel. i'm not into casual sex or any sex or ahhhh!!!! calm down, girl. you are not as ugly as you think you are. in fact, whether you are overweight or not, i'm sure you're probably a lot cuter than you think you are. if stats are an issue for you, don't put it in your ad. the reason men are not responding is not because you are, in your own words, fat, its cause you sound like you hate yourself. nobody, man or women, wants to be around a negative person. it's okay. you are okay. really.  p.s.s. while i'm ranting, women men do not expect you to look like supermodels!!! we think it would be nice if you did, but we don't expect it. when a man is alone with a woman, she is beautiful. she is there. she is real. she smells and tastes and sounds real. and that is beautiful.  god bless you crazy people.  maybe we're supposed to meet the wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift.  maybe when the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us.  maybe the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had. men can have a complete conversation and have it be a total of five words in as many hours.  maybe it is true that we don't know what we have got until we lose it but it is also true that we don't know what we have been missing until it arrives.  giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they will love you back. don't expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their heart; but if it does not, be content it grew in yours.  it takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.  don't go for looks; they can deceive. don't go for wealth; even that fades away. go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. find the one that makes your heart smile.  there are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real.  dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.  always put yourself in others' shoes. if you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too. the happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.  happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives.  love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a tear. the brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches.  when you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. live your life so that when you die, you are the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.", "essay1": "ummm things... good things... always good things.", "essay2": "a few good things and a few bad things. i know a little about a lot and a lot about a little.", "essay3": "intelligence, wit, cunning...", "essay4": "i'll read almost anything. i like convoluted stories... spy, mystery, even music like that.. jazz, classical, rock", "essay5": "i can and have done without most things and can do so again if i really had to.", "essay6": "existential motivation, dharma, pink floyd, obstructionism, value-added living", "essay7": "what i am. i'm a sailor man.", "essay8": "i'm not as smart as i'm perceived to be, but i'm probably smarter than your average bear.  also, this has been my favorite poem for a while.  my heart trembles like a poor leaf. the planets whirl in my dreams. the stars press against my window. i rotate in my sleep. my bed is a warm planet.", "essay9": "you appreciate someone who is multi-talented, unlimited, careful, wild, safe, sane, probing, questioning, collaborative, and of course, if you're beautiful, witty, intelligent, and kind yourself.", "essay": "yessss i need to do this.. i guess the sooner there's something more the better. ask. i do better with direct questions! i do well with nature and adventure, poorly with work attitude, excel with rationality and empathy, appreciate good people, have in-your-face desires with bad people, do chef stuff in the kitchen, fix most anything, geek out, read too many books too quickly, stay up and sleep late whenever possible, stay healthy, relish relaxation, confront challenges, resist hypocrisy, solve problems, listen carefully, spell poorly, and drive well.  here's a little ditty i ran across a few years ago. i like it, it makes sense, and i hope you like it also. let me know. no, i don't think you have crabs. and, if you take this seriously or think this is obnoxious, then please consider humor replacement therapy.  a guide to talking to women in bars and other things  before we begin, let's consider two basic points about women's (a) needs and (b) communication styles.  first, (a) women's needs:   women need security and women need to feel attractive. they need it, like men need approval. no psychobabble, it's just true.  secondly, (b) women's communication styles:   men communicate by demonstrating their accomplishments. this demonstrates their prowess and garners approval. listen to men talk: sports stats, their knowledge of movies, music, politics, their possessions, i did this, i did that, etc.,   women communicate to establish intimacy. i'm not sure why, cause i'm not a woman, but it's true. listen to them talk. they give all these details that seem so irrelevant. this is what i was wearing, and then janine said... and every guy wants to yell, get to the fuckin' point!! however, these details are not irrelevant to them. they are attempting to establish intimacy. so listen or at least look like you're listening. it's not important to a woman that her story is important to you. it's important that she feels like you know it's important to her.  please remember these two points: (a) women need security and they need to feel attractive and (b) they communicate to establish intimacy. this is as much a part of women as a strong pitching staff is to the new york yankees. curb your own communication style toward these two points and you will prosper. ignore these two points at your own risk.  okay, let's begin.  first off, don't use lines. can i buy you a drink? do you have the time? are those space-pants? cause your ass is out of this world! lines are stupid. you're a stud, you don't need lines.  be yourself. if you are a loud, funny, crazy guy, go with that. if you are shy and quiet, go with that. the more comfortable you are the better off you are.  now, go to the bar with a group of friends. you have strength and numbers, you show that you have a life, plus you need to take a wingman if you're going to talk to a woman who is not alone.  now, when you see the girl of choice, try to make a little eye contact, if you can. she's already noticed every guy in the place, just like you've noticed every cute girl. don't stand by, staring and drooling, if you she doesn't notice you after a short while (about the amount of time it takes you to slowly and calmly finish your drink), go over to her.  now, before you do, you must say these words to yourself and you must believe them 100%. i don't need this woman, and if i get shot down, so what, she probably has crabs.  try it now, just to yourself (make sure your co-workers/roommates aren't watching), i don't need this women, and if i get shot down, so what, she probably has crabs.  try it again, i don't need this women, and if i get shot down, so what, she probably has crabs.  and believe it. whether or not some chick in a bar likes you is meaningless. if she rejects you, it is completely inconsequential in the grand scheme of your life. you're a stud, trust me.  now, walk up to her and say, hi. i'm insert your name.' (shake her hand firmly, but don't be brutish; you probably outweigh her by fifty pounds). either she will say, so. or she will say, hi, i'm insert her name.' if she says, so, or anything comparable, shrug and walk away. she probably has crabs.  okay, so she tells you her name. now what? if she has a boring name (e.g. jen, maria, karen) don't say, wow, what a great name! but if her name is exotic, (margarita, ezmerelda, charlie), give her a very laid back comment. great name or that's pretty. don't gush. every other guy gushes. just a simple compliment will do.  if she has crazy hair or shiny blue eyes or some feature that looks like every guy has commented on it, don't say anything. please. if all goes well, you'll have plenty of time to compliment them another time.  now say, ezmerelda, how are you doing, tonight? sounds simple right? it is.  are you having a good night? if she says no, say, oh, that's too bad, i hope your night gets better. it was nice meeting you. cheers. leave. you do not need to get mixed up with someone like that. she either wants to be left alone or she's looking for pity. you don't need any pity cases, especially, pity cases with crabs. (no, she doesn't have actual crabs. it's a metaphor and if you haven't figured that out by now, then you probably have crabs.) :-)  if she says, yes, then you're in  here's how simple it is. here's how you talk to women, right here, right now...  you say, great. me too. my buddies and i are just kicking back after a great day of ____________.  (of course, you actually need to do something with your life.) (if all you do is play video games or watch movies or wrestle your monkey, you're fucked. you need more help then i can give.)  so what do you do with your life, stud? if you do outdoor stuff, say, after a great day of hiking. do you go to the beach? after a great day at the beach. hell, did you go out for lunch? say, after a great, laid back saturday. the idea is that you did something. and whatever you did, it was great. you are someone who enjoys life, you are setting the stage for intimacy and you are offering an emotion: enjoyment.  now here's the catch, she already knows whether you've got a shot. if you've gotten this far, she will either respond one of two ways. she will either respond with enthusiasm or she will not.  if she responds with enthusiasm (i.e., by asking questions), describe your day with the same degree of enthusiasm. if she is psyched, you be psyched. if she is mellow, you be mellow. then before you exhaust the topic, you switch gears. you ask her how her weekend, day, whatever, is going. if she volunteers the info, great, she's talking and beginning her own establishment of intimacy. and as we all know, that's what she needs.  (if she is not enthusiastic or interested, then she is not interested. at this point, say well, it was nice to meet you, excuse yourself, walk away, she probably has crabs, etc.)  i know it sounds trite, but what i really dislike about some people (not just women) is when they fail to ask questions and just talk about themselves.  keep her talking, ask her question and after question after question. don't talk about yourself. nothing is as boring to a woman as you. if she wants to know about you, she will ask. the only time you talk, besides asking the questions, is to relate a comparable story. but at this point, you direct the conversation by asking her questions and letting her establish intimacy.  if the conversation starts to stagnate, here are some basic questions to remember?  1. what kind of music do you like? a favorite artist/group? 2. are you from this area originally? 3. what kind of movies are you into? a favorite kind of movie? favorite movie? 4. what do you do for a living? 5. hobbies? 6. family? 7. do you travel? where would you go, if you could?*  *(number 7 is especially good. all women love travel and all women love fantasy. where would you go? is super. of course, don't use number 7 right away. build up to it and then, bang!)  now, you have to close the deal. when it feels right, say, let's get together some time. don't ask her. tell her. it's more natural. and she will like the confidence. if she especially liked you opener, ask her if she would like to join you the next time you're going to do it. or just ask her out to dinner. or a night on the town or the theatre or jesus, anything you and she would enjoy together.  (don't suggest anything for a first date that you don't want to do. the ballet will most likely bore the pants off of you. you'll get irritated, you'll get anxious and your first date will be your last. go to the park or have a picnic or something mutually enjoyable.)  great, let me have your phone number and i'll give you a call. that's it. you're done. now, if you say you are going to call, then call. women hate liars like every other team hates the world champion new york yankees.  so to recap:  1. be yourself. 2. hi, 3. how are you? 4. great, i (me and my buddies) are just kicking back after a great day of 5. questions, questions, questions 6. let's get together  and remember those seventeen magic words, \"i don't need this woman, and if i get shot down, so what, she probably has crabs.\"  so, there you go. that's how you talk to women. good luck.  p.s. to all you women reading this, i know there will be some, stop with the fucking expectations and self-deprecation in you ads.  1. if love is gonna happen, it will happen. you can't force it, no matter how loud your biological clock is ticking. meet the guy. talk to him. see what happens.  2. fat chick looking for love so what, i'm not a supermodel. i'm not into casual sex or any sex or ahhhh!!!! calm down, girl. you are not as ugly as you think you are. in fact, whether you are overweight or not, i'm sure you're probably a lot cuter than you think you are. if stats are an issue for you, don't put it in your ad. the reason men are not responding is not because you are, in your own words, fat, its cause you sound like you hate yourself. nobody, man or women, wants to be around a negative person. it's okay. you are okay. really.  p.s.s. while i'm ranting, women men do not expect you to look like supermodels!!! we think it would be nice if you did, but we don't expect it. when a man is alone with a woman, she is beautiful. she is there. she is real. she smells and tastes and sounds real. and that is beautiful.  god bless you crazy people.  maybe we're supposed to meet the wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift.  maybe when the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us.  maybe the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had. men can have a complete conversation and have it be a total of five words in as many hours.  maybe it is true that we don't know what we have got until we lose it but it is also true that we don't know what we have been missing until it arrives.  giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they will love you back. don't expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their heart; but if it does not, be content it grew in yours.  it takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.  don't go for looks; they can deceive. don't go for wealth; even that fades away. go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. find the one that makes your heart smile.  there are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real.  dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.  always put yourself in others' shoes. if you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too. the happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.  happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives.  love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a tear. the brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches.  when you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. live your life so that when you die, you are the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.\nummm things... good things... always good things.\na few good things and a few bad things. i know a little about a lot and a lot about a little.\nintelligence, wit, cunning...\ni'll read almost anything. i like convoluted stories... spy, mystery, even music like that.. jazz, classical, rock\ni can and have done without most things and can do so again if i really had to.\nexistential motivation, dharma, pink floyd, obstructionism, value-added living\nwhat i am. i'm a sailor man.\ni'm not as smart as i'm perceived to be, but i'm probably smarter than your average bear.  also, this has been my favorite poem for a while.  my heart trembles like a poor leaf. the planets whirl in my dreams. the stars press against my window. i rotate in my sleep. my bed is a warm planet.\nyou appreciate someone who is multi-talented, unlimited, careful, wild, safe, sane, probing, questioning, collaborative, and of course, if you're beautiful, witty, intelligent, and kind yourself.\n", "essays_len": 13779}, {"age": "yes", "status": "single", "sex": "m", "orientation": "bisexual", "education": "yes", "ethnicity": "white, other", "income": "-1", "job": "education / academia", "location": "berkeley, california", "essay0": "i'm a queer, radical, easily bored, interested in everything genderqueer ftm. i'm neither male nor bisexual, but that's the closest i could get. i do not wear rainbows nearly as often as the profile pic would suggest.  i am not looking for new serious emotional commitments. i am looking for casual hookups, fun flings and/or mild adventures with cute, emotionally intelligent people. in other words i don't want a lot from you emotionally - but i want it to be really good.  i mostly go for queer masculine-ish people who have interesting genders.

weird shit, maynard) - \"shit i need to remember to do that\" - if gwen cooper should fix that gap in her teeth - \"why the hell are my car keys in the freezer?\" - \"now what about xyz got me so bent out of shape?\" - \"shit i need to remember to do that - \"i like corn!\" - what hilarity i'll find on peopleofwalmart.com - \"crap, what if i go and they don't talk to me?\" - \"crap, what if i go and they try to talk to me?\" - my friends who have died - \"i want my crossword\" - figuring out what it means to live a balanced life - \"shit i need to remember to do that\" - \"how did i not notice before how hot soccer players are??\" - pen twirling - what i'm going to order at the restaurant i'm going to be eating at in the near future - how love in its purest form feels much more like a state of being, a part of my being, rather than an emotion - \"shit i can't believe i forgot to do that\"  etc etc etc.  and i know for a fact there will always be more to add. all these thoughts can cycle through my head at dangerous velocity, so stand back if i appear to be lost in thought. you could lose a limb.  as always, more to come (technically speaking, this will be true until i die)\n\ni eat english cucumbers like apples. in their entirety.  i also like to eat my corn on the cob one row at a time.  i usually drink my hot coffee with a straw, leading to more ridicule but less spillage.  i cuss like a truck driver.  when i was a kid, i'd make sure nobody else was around, close all the doors, put on bob marley's \"exodus\" and choreograph dances to it.  i'm a sucker for a genius\nyou are dr. daniel jackson on stargate sg-1. if so, you should contact me immediately.  or  we seem like we would have fun together. :) lately i've been seized by the sudden urge to go play in the snow, and to hop in a car to go see what that whole \"mystery spot\" in santa cruz is all about. planned adventures, random adventures, \"i wonder what would happen if i pushed that button\" adventures :) and in fact, the first time we go out together, maybe we could actually go do something fun instead of just drinking coffee staring at each other across the table. after all, what better way to break the ice than to laugh together :d  you have time in your life for the possibility of me being in it  and maybe, just maybe, you'd be willing to take a chance.  oh, and bonus points if you know the difference between current-state and state-transition digital transmission! ;)  (however: if we do go out & you don't feel a connection with me, be up front about that, it's ok! don't go making specific plans for dinner three days later with me but then go & block me from your profile! could doing something like that be any more cliche??)\n", "essays_len": 8178}, {"age": "no", "status": "single", "sex": "m", "orientation": "straight", "education": "yes", "ethnicity": "asian, pacific islander", "income": "-1", "job": "medicine / health", "location": "south san francisco, california", "essay0": "", "essay1": "", "essay2": "eating, having a good time, fixing or figuring out problems, and singing la bamba on guitar hero.", "essay3": "", "essay4": "the office (seasons 1-4), madmen, bukowski, good will hunting, and baked ziti.", "essay5": "", "essay6": "what i can do on my days off.", "essay7": "saving lives or driving/riding the streets of sf.", "essay8": "i have a problem with my left eye drifting when i'm super tired.", "essay9": "if you're driven to make your mark on the world but know how to enjoy a lazy sunday. like motorcycles, and enjoy a rich social life. also, if you enjoy eating all kinds of food and can't even begin to name your favorites, we should hang out.", "essay": "\n\neating, having a good time, fixing or figuring out problems, and singing la bamba on guitar hero.\n\nthe office (seasons 1-4), madmen, bukowski, good will hunting, and baked ziti.\n\nwhat i can do on my days off.\nsaving lives or driving/riding the streets of sf.\ni have a problem with my left eye drifting when i'm super tired.\nif you're driven to make your mark on the world but know how to enjoy a lazy sunday. like motorcycles, and enjoy a rich social life. also, if you enjoy eating all kinds of food and can't even begin to name your favorites, we should hang out.\n", "essays_len": 568}, {"age": "no", "status": "single", "sex": "m", "orientation": "straight", "education": "", "ethnicity": "hispanic / latin", "income": "-1", "job": "other", "location": "berkeley, california", "essay0": "ok me?

piques my interest. when i'm feeling pensive or want to relax, i'll put on some sigur rs, lemon jelly, or air, and just let my mind wander. when i'm feeling happy and just want to hear something that

wonderful people... how ever did we get this misguided administration if we are a democracy?\nshake off thinking about work by doing an exercise activity, maybe run or a bikram yoga class. then join friends or go to some entertainment like a movie or play. some friday nights i am heading out of town to go skiing or other excursion with friends.\ni like to laugh... though a guy that's all humor and cracks jokes about everthing can make a lot of laughs happen, but at the end of time together communication and intimacy might not have had a chance.\nplease message me if you want to tell me something fun or interesting or nice :-) or if you think we could be friends or activity partners in something and you want a real-world friend.  a wish list i would especially like to meet is a man that wholeheartedly participates in life and is kind, ethical, thoughtful, curious, knowledgeable, artistic, communicative, affectionate, romantic. and if you have confidence in the possible greatness of this planet, your own life and a joyous romantic relationship, you could be my dream boat!\n", "essays_len": 3396}, {"age": "no", "status": "available", "sex": "f", "orientation": "bisexual",

titles... vickie christina barcelona! gotta love it. only woody allen could get so much mileage out of a 1 song soundtrack. there's so much more: up, casino royale, conan the barbarian (dialog blows

yes, the coffee-rubbed pork shoulder at range is often a little too salty, and yes, i like it anyway. you're free to treat me to french laundry or whats-her-name's place in berkeley. i thought myth

 sweet.  now don't think i'm going to tell you everything about myself. that would spoil all the fun! so instead of listing facts about \"this thing i did,\" or \"that stuff i do,\" i'll just work it in naturally. i have lots and lots of stories, which will emerge over time.  \"radical congruence.\" what means? for me radical congruence means: i'm not going pull any punches. i'm not going to say one thing here and another in person. i'm not going to pretend to be something i'm not. and i am most definitely not going to post my \"resume.\" you can google my credentials later if you're interested.  and overall, i'm fairly quiet, happy, and friendly.\nbuilding my way out of the rat race.  just back from burning man. very cool.  some new pictures posted. even more coming.\nmaking things happen.\ni'm generally approachable. dogs, cats, horses, children, people... mostly i lean back and let natural mammal curiosity take over, let them approach on their own terms.  another thing: i tend to get judged on my looks, but i'm not who they think i am. i used to be pretty. now i'm merely handsome. this is a simple statement of fact, being good-looking has nothing to do with being attractive, but it will get you stereotyped and pigeonholed.\npartial to history (durant, tuchman), some classic lit (english & russian) , mix of contemporary genres just for fun, e.g., \"spymaster's lady\" ;) i could get really pretentious here with some heavy lifting (i.e., math, technical), i'll pass on that.  movies... good question... but directors, or titles? let's go with directors: wong kar wai, lina wertmuller and liliana cavani for starters. maybe a swing through shainberg as well.  titles... vickie christina barcelona! gotta love it. only woody allen could get so much mileage out of a 1 song soundtrack. there's so much more: up, casino royale, conan the barbarian (dialog blows but the body language is pretty good!), king fu hustle, steven chow rocks it. room with a view. i could go on and on.  food: discerning but not picky. i'm cool with everything from bk to gary danko. yes, the coffee-rubbed pork shoulder at range is often a little too salty, and yes, i like it anyway. you're free to treat me to french laundry or whats-her-name's place in berkeley. i thought myth was a little overrated... but the food and service were good. quince is pretty cool, and not at all snooty if you use the manners you were raised with. i've done the raw thing in santa monica... it's ok. vegan is fine. good vegan is even better. in general, my philosophy is that food is good to eat.  music: pretty much anything in context. i've seen everything from kathleen battle at a revival to the who doing tommy (whole thing) live in concert. so, whatever, it's all good. that being said, i tend to gravitate toward jazz genres along the miles in a silent way sessions, really early blues influenced rock (sabbath first album, heep), beethoven symphonies and piano work (beethoven would have *definitely* been a metal head), deep house, psychill, ambient and downtempo for the more contemporary sounds. i'm cool with trance (van buuren, schulz, wisternoff, van dyke) in moderation.  as i think about it... i'm playing mostly stuff along the lines of thievery corp, morphine, ben watt and zero 7 at the moment.  actually, i'm mostly listening to groovera's low mercury on itunes. bought some good music from their playlist.\ngood friends, open sky, fresh air, big water.\nbuilding my business. i am absolutely committed to that. if that's a problem, we're not going to get along.\nsometimes out, sometimes catching up so i can enjoy the weekend.\nsmart (intellectual even), prudent, frugal & thrifty, stable, honest, hard working, fiscally conservative, socially liberal, get up early, productive... private. very private, and discrete.  if that sounds boring... well, that's why it's private now, isn't it?

written, \"living my life\" or \"what am i not doing\"...come on. that's an easy way out of not fessing up to shit. i'm in my mid-twenties, dropped out of college twice and would have to admit i don't have my shit together nearly as much as i would like too. but when i compare myself to people my age i actually feel pretty good about where i'm at. i have a good job, even though it might not be my passion, and make enough money to pay my bills, have fun and get out of town to travel.\n-making fun of people walking down the street in my head. -having way too large of a breadth of musical knowledge. -making my friends bust a gut, creating elaborate inside jokes, and being all around ridiculous. -not giving a fuck about the little shit. -sleeping in way later then i should. -that's what she said jokes. -dominoes. -reading people. -making out. a lost art-form.\nhmmm...my dashingly rugged exterior... i'm a rocker, if you can't get down with bullet belts, black, leather and studs, then...however i won't judge you. i think i come off as unapproachable some times, just cuz i don't really care about most people. however if you take the time to talk to me, i think you'd see me differently.\nthis is the hardest part. i am a nerd in many different ways. it bugs when people say the kinda nerdy and the just like starwars. i mean, c'mon...  books/authors- fritz leiber, bukowski, palahniuk, douglas adams, anais nin, hemmingway... comics- osamu tezuka, paul pope, mike mignola, geoff darrow, frank miller, gabriel ba, eric powell, alan moore, hiroaki samura, theo ellswoth, brandon graham, guy davis, neil gaiman, warren ellis, matt fraction, frazzato....  movies- night watch trilogy, the warriors, barbarella, cemetery man, return of the living dead, night of the demons, anything argento, anything terry gilliam, hedwig, miyazaki, anything ralph bakshi, all the silly eighties fantasy and sci-fi shit. real big into asian cimema, pretty much all samurai movies (especially anything with tatsuya nakadai), japanese super-gore films, chan-wook park stuff...list goes forever...  music- into almost everything. no new country, or nu metal! punk- lots of '77 and 80's. buzzcocks, the kids, death, the depressions, the action, the vibrators, anti-nowhere league, the plasmatics, uk subs, sham 69, the adverts, the protex, chron gen, the special duties, torcha shed...japanese hardcore, into a little crust also... metal-80's metal blade stuff, black metal, trash/revival trash, doom, stoner, tradition down-tempo, death... also insanely into garage and psych from 60's and 70's, way toooo many to name...also 80's new wave and pop, and totally down with the hippity'hops. i also have to admit i've always been really into electronica too.... now i'm just getting lazy and don't want to name more things off...oh, whoever i think emo is for whinny teenagers (which it is), and i really don't like anything that could be call \"indie-rock\" of bluegrass...\n-people that make me laugh and keep me sane. -music - vinyl and digital. -my bike - will not ride the bus! -the fucking sun already! not really enough of it around here... -phone/camera - compulsive shutter bug. -sriracha -oh and the internet maybe. can't. stay. away.\nthe future and the past. in both good and bad ways i guess...\nworking... but i'd rather not be...\nwell there's a lot to admit to... maybe always think the grass is greener on the other side of the fence (yeah i know that's cheap).\nif any of this looks appealing and you want to spend any amount of time in each others company...like a date i guess, or just hanging-out, or whatev's. i think that's normally why people would message each other on here, right?\n", "essays_len": 5490}, {"age": "yes", "status":

art punker trying to retain the zest and zeal of youth and continuing to challenge, push and progress ....while at the same time finding the necessary grounding and realism to allow me the foundation to be able to keep sustaining that quest!  oh, and also how to answer these questions with the right mix of sass, intelligence and flirtation so that i stimulate both your mind and your loins and make

monogamous relationship as many here are..put that out there right away so everyone is on the same page...  and if you've gotten past that and are reading on, probably a good indicator you've got just the kind of open mind and spirit i'm looking to get to know.. no real agenda here other then getting to know some some cool people and whatever uniqueness they bring to the world..non-judgemental and open to all.. a fun attitude wins out over style any day...that being said, a wickedly frisky side is never a bad thing as i have one of those myself..  open for everything from good friends, to friends with benefits, or even just two people with a great connection who get together for the kind of trouble that leaves us breathless and almost lauging at the carnal absurdity that just took place..from mild to wild, up for wherever the energy of the day, as well as natural attraction and desire lead us..\n", "essays_len": 3261}, {"age": "yes", "status": "single", "sex": "m",

(btw - i've created a test to find out how well these aspects of mine fit you. if you'd like to find out:  http://www.helloquizzy.com/tests/are-you-an-other-test).  truth be told, these aspects may not even apply to wizards specifically. in conversation i usually name the people who have these traits as \"other\", as opposed to \"normals\". perhaps you have more items that could be listed? i'm not talking about socio-culturally induced actions and patterns, but inherent traits. check out the list (i've just added two more) and see if you relate or how much you relate and please, let me know...  of course, any discussion on this subject is quite acceptable, so please feel free to respond in any way you like!

and many thanks for the messages! ;-}d>  now back to our previously running program, already in progress... for fun - and hopefully soon for profit - http://sites.google.com/site/wizardlsite/twlu-home  to put it plainly, i am looking for \"other wizards\". over the past few years i've met only one or possibly two that seem to fit the aspects i've come up with that makes me different (see the list below). i'm feeling a yearning to commune with my own kind, if that's at all possible. at the very least it would be good to know if there are at least a few others out there...  (btw - i've created a test to find out how well these aspects of mine fit you. if you'd like to find out:  http://www.helloquizzy.com/tests/are-you-an-other-test).  truth be told, these aspects may not even apply to wizards specifically. in conversation i usually name the people who have these traits as \"other\", as opposed to \"normals\". perhaps you have more items that could be listed? i'm not talking about socio-culturally induced actions and patterns, but inherent traits. check out the list (i've just added two more) and see if you relate or how much you relate and please, let me know...  of course, any discussion on this subject is quite acceptable, so please feel free to respond in any way you like! thoughts on this from any perspective is interesting to me, so have at it!  many thanks! ;-}d>  wizardly aspects and properties: 1 - your thinking is not necessarily linear (ex: a -> b -> c -> d -> conclusion or 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> conclusion) but varied and non-linear (ex: a -> b -> 5 -> 23 -> theta -> zeta -> pi -> diogenes -> conclusion)  2 - you are aware that your thinking processes are arranged in multiple parallel trains of thought, not just one train that keeps changing tracks  3 - you are aware, even at the height of a consuming emotion (as in being very angry), of all or most of your other emotions about the subject at the same time.  4 - you naturally can see \"the big picture\"  5 - you can comfortably believe in two or more diametrically opposed or contradictory things / philosophies at the same time (and i don't mean switching back and forth quickly)  6 - you have odd, peculiar, unusual, paranormal or impossible things happen to / around you on a frequent / daily basis. the ideas of \"chance\", \"odds\" and \"coincidence\" seem like fiction.  7 - you tend to be scientific and mystical, without contradiction  8 - you have surprisingly good foresight  9 - you tend to be a \"natural\" at most of the things you attempt  10 - you can look at something and not only see it's component parts but almost automatically see it's various potential configurations and other uses. you easily see beyond the surface of things to what something can be  11 - you maintain a consistent body weight / configuration for decades without thinking or dieting, no matter how much or how little you eat  12 - you tend to look a lot younger than your physical age  13 - you tend to feel a whole hell of a lot older than your physical age  14 - you have a tendency to use bio-feedback with well more than average success, even if you don't know what bio-feedback is  15 - you have the deep-seated feeling that you are far from home, a feeling that you are \"out of place\" even among friends / family  16 - people look at you strangely when you say something that makes perfectly plain sense to you. you are also very familiar with the phrase \"how the heck did you come up with that idea?\"  17 - you have a terrible sense of time, but a great sense of timing  18 - you can recognize \"omens\" easily and most of the time accurately derive their meanings  19 - you can manipulate energies pretty easily (for example, you know how to catch your \"15th wind\", or your \"36th wind\" no matter how long a task takes)  20 - you, or the people who know you, consider you an \"independent thinker\"  21 - your interests are many, and varied  22 - your ability to concentrate is such that nothing can disrupt you when you're very focused  23 - you have a tendency to be very, very lucky or unlucky  24 - you have the ability to heal quickly, and have higher than usual immunity to common maladies  25 - you are quite comfortable being alone. you can work with a team, but you do better \"referring\" to the team about your efforts  26 - you have \"authority issues\"  27 - you have a surprising lack of fear when it comes to the subject death  28 - you have actually died at one point, and yet here you are  29 - you have a strength of willpower that even surprises you  30 - in dangerous or frightening situations, you feel neither the danger nor the fright, though perhaps you feel you should. you automatically go into \"action mode\" when such things occur, and quite often sense the slowing down of time and activity around you  31 - you have an insatiable curiosity about most everything  32 - you have a natural tendency to notice even tiny details, especially in your surroundings  33 - you don't get jealous. in fact, you wouldn't know how to even if it were necessary. it's just not in you.  34 - even if you believe in and practice monogamy and stay committed to one person at a time, you have the ability to love more than one person at a time.  35 - animals, with few exceptions, either really like you or really don't like you.  36 - you have an instant understanding of why something won't work, even if you can't explain it right away.  37 - you get an \"instant impression\" about people you've just met, and it's rarely wrong. --------------------------------------------------------------------------\nat this point (july '10) i'm still trying to do more of my own creative stuff without having to work 20 hr days. the warehouse is starting to cripple me and starting in august i will start reversing that process!  in the meantime, the organizing of my living space and studio space continues, as well as trying to find someone with whom i can be entirely myself. my ex-girlfriend and i get along very well... in fact, now that we're out of our romantic relationship we're much more in tune with each other (or at least so i think).  main activities? my job, my artwork, seeking out a few hours that i can spend with my fave people, and taking classes at the grey school of wizardry... hmmm, strange how things haven't changed all that much in a year...\n-finding things i need / want (usually off the street!) -fixing -building things -reading -inventing / creating things -foreplay -sensuality -aquaria -packing things (i'm a pack master, and can make the most out of the least space) -psychology -making friends with animals -being silly -being romantic -debating -writing (so long as i don't attempt it in the morning) -microsoft excel -computer hardware -programming -biofeedback -foresight -cooking (when i'm in the mood), especially desserts and soups -sleeping! -collecting -horseback riding -climbing, rocks or trees or the walls (one of my heroes is tarzan) -psychology (with a couple exceptions) see item #10 -languages -traveling (though i am directionally challenged - i can get lost coming out of an elevator in a two-story building!) -getting lost! -being non-jealous (see my ex-girlfriend and ex-wife for references) -puns! ... to be continued\nmy hair - and of late, my beard! what they eventually notice is that i'm not from around here... wherever i go on this planet...\nok - fave movies (though not a complete list): 10,000 bc 101 dalmations 9-1/2 weeks the abyss a

is - my husband is coming back soon and at the moment, i'm looking for friends, maybe play partners at bdsm parties, but mostly friends. especially interested in female friends, but i'm also looking for men who can do the friends thing without needing to push it into sex immediately, if ever. i have male friends, and most are gay. wouldn't mind hanging with some gay or bi guys. straight men too; just don't expect sex right now. you will see things about sex in the second paragraph. i'm not taking it down, because in a few months, i may be looking for friends with benefits again, and i like what i wrote so just ignore the sex part of the following paragraph if it's anywhere near april, 2012. it might be germaine later, but not now. first off, i'm common-law married, so i'm not looking to fall in love or anything like that. he's working back east and often doesn't come back for months, but he is my man. he's out of town now, but will be back in april. we do have an open relationship. we're not poly like in dossie easton's book; it's more that we both know we're doing it with others and neither one of us wants in each other's face. am basically a poet and general artsy type who likes to read a lot and go out to events - the weirder the better. i like horror and urban fantasy novels, taking long walks in the city (not so much a nature person, but could be persuaded - no long hikes up hills), futzing around on the computer, attending poetry readings, and just playing. i'm a bit of a freak; i'm a former punk rocker and still like to wear old leather motorcycle jackets and leopard print clothes. i'm also a street poet(\"street\" as a genre; i live indoors) and have two chapbooks out. also writing my memoirs. looking for friends, or maybe biologically female play partners (i'm kinky, and a switch with a lot of experience). i have long, wavy auburn hair, blue eyes, and fair skin.  i'm looking for women and some select men. i'm kind of into guys on the quirky side or the mildly bad boy side (no actual criminals, please). i usually like women who are younger than me and alternative. fellow freaks of all genders feel free to contact me, too.\ni'm basically trying to figure out what i want to do, and do it. i realize this is not the best position to be in during my forties.. i'm not working in my field right now i like to take long walks, and not around nature so much; i'm a city woman. i'm trying to work through writer's block and also hoping to get in another band (i was in a psychedelic band, but it didn't work out). i read a lot.\nwriting, reading, appreciating others. being eccentric, studying, getting into esoteric things like astrology and wicca, coming up with kooky ideas, bdsm and some other fetishes.\nmy hair, my smile, perhaps the fact that i'm a bit hesitant or shy on first meeting, an intensity in my eyes. a certain amount of nervousness around new people (it wears off if i like you).\n\"neverwhere\", neil gaiman, \"city

parties or poetry readings around.\ni can't figure out how to approach this question, so i'm not going to answer it.\nyou're a guy who wants to be friends at this point. someone to go to parties with or horror movies and thrillers, or art shows and poetry readings (preferably spoken word on the gritty side; pretty poetry usually bores me). you're a biological female who either wants to be friends

person looking for an equally quirky and interesting girl. i'm not very serious and pretty adventurous. i spend a lot of weekends up in tahoe during the winter and would love to meet someone new back here in the bay. i love nature, science, marine life, animals, the outdoors, the mountains and the ocean. i think i'm an unusual combination of a nerd and a jock. i try to exercise and stay as active as i can, but i also really value down time, relaxing at home, watching movies and taking my dog out. just went skydiving for the first time and loved it! my goal now is to find as many other sports/activities that will fulfill that same adrenaline rush...  i'm looking for someone who's genuine, honest, loyal, unique, athletic, adventurous, sarcastic and is able to laugh at themselves. while confidence is obviously a very attractive quality in a person, so is humility. eating out is always fun, but so is staying in and cooking. it's all about balance.  i'm a little obsessed with dogs and just adopted an 8 month old. it's been a ton of work so far, but totally worth it. i think they're one of the simplest and greatest things ever. i like to cook and really like being cooked for. i love to go skiing (a little too much), scuba diving and biking. i have a great job that i truly love. i get to work with animals, be creative, active and challenged in a beautiful setting. i think enjoying what you do for a living is really important and often underrated. i grew up in the bay area and went to college back east. so i feel like i'm a good combination of the different cultures. my family is also really important to me. i'm not that in to drinking and partying anymore, although once in a while it's definitely still a good time.\ni work at a public museum, managing the living collection. i just recently adopted a dog and spend a lot of time hanging out with her. i love to ski and spend almost every weekend in the winter up in tahoe.\nskiing, being a fish

playground, is what life is really all about for me. i reside in my townhome on the san francisco bay where i wake up to the gulls every morning. i enjoy the city and all its rich's as often as i can. i'm especially impressed with the music, the food, giants baseball and all the colorful people that make the city what it is. i'm very grateful that i'm old enough and young enough to appreciate what life has in store for me going forward. i've traveled to many cities in the us and very soon i will have an opportunity to experience traveling abroad. if i should be so lucky again, to pour all my love into that special deserving someone, it would truly be a bonus going forward. i, i, i, i........\ncutting back on the work and enjoying life. i'm making plans to semi-retire soon and looking into traveling abroad. i'm currently sailing, playing music, salsa, biking, enjoying giants baseball. my sail boat is at the at&t giants boat harbor where i sleep over on occasion when i'm seriously enjoying the cities riches. oh yes, i'm spending a little time looking for that special someone.\ncommunication, laughing, affection, being respectful, being positive, kissing, hugging and all that comes with that (so i'm told) ;-).\nthe buzz created when i enter the room! ;) my smile, huge sense of humor, courteous and respectful nature. communication skills.\n\nmy family, family of friends, music, laughing out loud, the water, the arts. iphone, lap top (need to stay in touch with the world)\nalthough my default world is very satifying, i'm always thinking about more exciting or educational things to do or see with my free time. how fortunate i am for my health, family and friends.\ni really don't have a typical friday night. i do like riding bikes, dancing, city dinning and listening to good live music. at times i just hang out in the harbor with friends over a class a wine and some good conversation.\nreally? we can talk about this in private?\nif you can bring some good gut laughs to the show! i am looking for a good friend, a lover and a partner to share some wonderful experiences in the years to come. she must be intelligent, open-minded, considerate, honest, respectful, affectionate, sensual, and have a great sense of humor. i am attracted to someone who takes good care of herself without being painfully vain. i am attracted to someone that is comfortable in their own skin and has a passion for things that make her complete when i'm not there. hopefully you're the one that gets us off this site!  post a picture and no smokers please. thank you\n",

constantly filtering through articles, reports, and research papers. but as much as i crave knowledge i also crave new friends to share stimulating conversations with.  just as i hunger for knowledge i get cravings for physical activity, i just can't stand being inactive for too long. rather it's hiking, climbing, sports, or a city wide game of hide n seek, i'm always looking for something to do

but it's always worth the time to me.  being awesome. not to sound conceited, but i've been told that quite a bit in my short term here on this planet and i'm beginning to wonder if it's reasonable

tasting or going to spas, drinking wine while sitting in a hot tub is much better. i like to have pretty toes, pedicures are lovely, but i do way to much cooking, gardening and pottery for manicure to last more then 5 hours. atheist or agnostic? that was the hardest question for me. to check the atheist box is so bold, it's sexy. but if the definition is believing that there is nothing else, then i can't quite do it. i don't know if there is more or not, i don't think there is anyway of knowing one way or the other. i don't believe in a god that resembles anything i heard if so far, but i believe far more exists then we are capable of imagining, and i love science, the pursuit of trying to know more. i like some of the buddhist ideas, like hopelessness, being present, and mindfulness. i tried to meditate but can't sit still and do nothing for more then about 30 seconds. throwing pots on the wheel is very meditative and so is running after the 4th mile. i don't like going to the gym, (actually i've never been to one). i like to run along the beach and up through golden gate park playing new order, the national, gotan project and page france with lady ga ga and pulp to help me get up the hills.\ni teach children to love being outside and to be constantly curious. i garden, i make things, i run, i drink lots of tea. i look on goldstar to find new things to do.\ncooking, gardening, fixing things, throwing pots, camping\n?\ni love to read; murakami, calvino, any random fiction from the library, science writing, magazines, new york times, my favourite iphone apps, -public radio, last fm, this american life, seeing my nieces and nephews on fb movies; princess bride, exit through the gift shop, blue planet, shaun of the dead, darjeeling limited, fantastic mr. fox, the goonies, tv; british comedies, documentaries, 30 rock\njust six?\nbiodiversity, glaze combinations, how to make the meringue crispy on lemon meringue pie.\nthere are better nights to go

recover from the week. sometimes that's with friends, drink in hand, watching a movie, playing games, or just hanging out. other times that means relaxing at home and catching up on my backlog of books and games.\ni might be addicted to alliteration, ellipses, and parenthetical statements. somebody call an editor!  verily, i ken the difference twixt the homonyms of \"yore.\" i'm a word nerd, not a grammar nazi. no point in being uptight about it; language is fluid and fun.\n... you think we might be a good match. i'm looking for a woman who is smart, open, creative, kind, and doesn't take herself too seriously.  you get major bonus points if you know your droids from your daleks (or otherwise consider yourself a bit of a geek or nerd).  i'm not interested in a casual hook up. i'm looking for a short term relationship that ultimately becomes long term and committed. if we find that friends is what suits us best, then that's great, too.\n", "essays_len": 5560}, {"age": "no",
