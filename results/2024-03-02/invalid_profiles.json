[2] connection: in my world, there are five relevant areas in which two people can connect: physical, mental, emotional, spiritual and energetic. all are important for a sustainable long-term intimate relationship. but of course there are different types of relationships, and it sometimes takes a while to figure out what the appropriate type is for the two people involved. indeed, there are more and more complications at every turn. so it goes.  so back to the five levels. two people may well connect on one or more, but to have a sustainable long-term intimate relationship, one needs (or at least i do) to connect on all five. a sign of my maturity, of late, is that i no longer believe that 100% connection on all levels is necessary, but i do think 80% or so on at least most of them is.  but of course people change in both the long and the short term.  anyway, without going on too long here, i hope you get the outline at least of what i'm looking for. i really am open to and hoping to find my life's partner, and to spending the rest of our lives exploring intimacy, connection and joy together in all the relevant ways. wouldn't that be lovely! in the meantime, however, i hope to enjoy the process of finding her, however long that takes.  my main motivating factor in life is to penetrate beneath the surface into the juicy heart of things, thereby inspiring and nourishing everyone i come into contact with. in that light, there is this mysterious dimension called sympathy', electricity', chemistry' or simply energetic connection'. you certainly know it when you feel it; at least i do. and of course that also happens (or can happen) on numerous levels simultaneously, thereby also increasing the complexity of coupling. yipes! why can't things be simple? do you suppose god is jewish too? and that klezmer was the original music of the spheres at creation?

[i can't imagine there is much latin on this site; in that light, i'd like to add two more sayings: fortuna favet audaci, and amor vincit omnia!] finally, and also from the reshad field book, i was blown away in my youth by the quotation--ostensibly from st francis-- that \"what we are looking for is what is looking\"!", "essay2": "eating, walking, cuddling, reading, massaging and being affectionate, although not necessarily in that order. i'm also pretty good at reading horoscopes, hint, hint! i'm also really good at listening, and being responsive, as well as being proactive.  i am a great fan of and would very much like to cultivate a regular practice of sacred sensuality/sexuality. in my world, sex and spirit are not in any way irreconcilable.  i'm not particularly good at sitting idly by, or waiting for stuff to happen.  i am also very good at picking produce, both fruits and vegetables.", "essay3": "my intense blue eyes and my smile, perhaps also my posture. they probably also notice that i can be wildly flirtatious, although i've done my best in later years to keep this more under my hat. i can't help it; there's nothing i'd rather have on the end of my line of sight that a beautiful inspiring magnificent woman.", "essay4": "my favorite novel overall is apuleius's golden ass; the most inspiring work of history i've read is frances yates's giordano bruno and the hermetic tradition. i also love tom robbins and alan watts. let's not forget kurt vonnegut, another scorpio with midwestern tendencies. i've also been inspired by the work of franz kafka, who seems to have understood the fundamental absurdities of life more clearly than most. my favorite is the trial. i fear, however, that i don't read much fiction, considering truth to not only be more interesting, but often more beautiful as well.  another of my favorite books is james hillman's brilliant and provocative revisioning psychology.  i also love alan watts's books, including his beautifully titled autobiography: \"in my own way.\" in it, he said that his main goals in life were to \"screw the inscrutable and eff the ineffable.\" i couldn't agree more!  my favorite movies are wings of desire and the wizard of oz. that said, i love cinema of many varieties. i lived in new york last year. one of the best parts about being there was becoming a member of moma, which allowed me access to their amazing film program, where, among other things, i saw the opening of winter's bone, with the director and a number of the actors. what an amazing film.  the best thing i've seen lately though is 'the disappearance of alice creed.' truly brilliant, however disturbing.  and of course i'm a great lover of italian cinema, especially fellini, and within his ouvre, the satyricon.  i love a broad range of music. my favorite bands are u2, bruce springsteen, the doors, and more recently dave matthews and the red hot chili peppers. i also love stravinsky's rites of spring and anything by chet baker. i also love a range of world music, both to listen and dance to, from king sunny ade to boca do rio to bunny wailer.  i shouldn't forget peter gabriel and king crimson from the '80s. living in austin in the '80s was a sublime experience. i crave sublime experiences, not to mention a little ecstasy every now and again (not the drug!).  and i just saw linda tillery in berkeley. they were amazing!  hardly, strictly bluegrass was wonderful. i saw five great acts: trombone shorty, the carolina chocolate drops, doc watson (i hope my groove is still working so well at 87!), nick lowe, and the magnificent sharon jones and the dap kings. what a blast!  concerning food, there is a broad range, once again, but i'm completely smitten these days with an indian buffet joint on 9th avenue. i really do love a broad range of cuisines. one of my favorite newish restaurants is a middle eastern place called jannah. it's affordable and delicious, and the owner is a peach of a man. i got spoiled on middle eastern food while living in pasadena though, in particular armenian food. mm, mm. i also have a taste for polish food, but i won't go any further into that now. and also good old jewish deli. living on the upper west side last year with easy access to murray's and to tal's bagels made my experience there all the more memorable.  my sister is one of the great foodie's of all time. she too lives in sf and always has a memorable restaurant to recommend.", "essay5": "cuddling, good music, good beer, good herb, love and affection. and also my family, who are magnificent!", "essay6": "love, history and the mysteries of life. also why things are as they are, and why our current political situation is so disastrous. you would think that after all these years of human civilization, we would have figured out some of the basics by now. and we have the chutzpah to call ourselves 'homo sapiens'; would that it were so!

allen's midnight in paris, the new muppet movie, and george and mike kuchar's night of the bomb and sin of the fleshopoids. not in theaters: hayao miyazaki/studio ghibli films, um some other stuff  music!: ah so old, too! i've discovered i'm turning into that person that reads/talks about music more than they listen to/create it. i don't know how i feel about that. relatively contemporary classical music (e.g. nico muhly, steve reich, terry riley), american folk in its many incarnations (e.g. smithsonian folkways sorts of stuff, joanna newsom, bruce springsteen), strange classical/popular amalgamations (e.g. sam amidon, the books, antony and the johnsons), and the occasional outlier (e.g. janelle monae, the distillers, tuneyards). also, pretty much every icelandic musician i've ever heard. this list is neither comprehensive nor comprehensible. mix tape exchange, anyone?  food!: vegan/vegetarian food. fermented foods are always a favorite. anything but papayas, which to me are the edible equivalent of farts and stinky feet combined.  tv?: right now, downton abbey, sherlock.. i'm pretty bad at watching tv, and tend to have to remind myself to do it.",

cancer called \"dying to be me.\" since i am a graduate student of spanish (meaning from spain) and latin american literature i have too many favorite authors to name, but my ultimate favorite latin american author is jorge luis borges.  i love movies like \"the matrix,\" movies that question reality and movies that show the power and potential of every human being such as \"the million dollar baby.\" funny movies are also very high on my list. i also like animated funny movies like \"puss in boots.\" just because they are animated doesn't mean they are only for kids! i do love romantic movies as well, but i am not a mushy mushy girl! come on guys, you know you like some of them, don't lie! i like the movie i.q. with meg ryan because it makes you think about how you can be a stand for what you want in life and it's about love. so you've gotten by now that i love thinking movies and books!  as for music i love listening to music in spanish: love songs, rock, salsa, tango music!

knows what it means to live in the present moment and are grateful for life.  you also desire spiritual partnership. for more info on spiritual partnership youtube a video putting in the info:\" lilou mace and gary zukav\" and you will really get what i am talking about. i am a spiritual person who wants a spiritual partnership. spiritual partnership is all about growth in a relationship where you tenderly grow together and put aside blame, judgment, etc...all of those things that do not work. as you have probably guessed by now, i am about positive growth, flourishing and living an empowered

hoping the woman i meet will also be open to trying new things, and not be set in her ways about everything. i once heard a theory that women have a raw sensuality, but it's difficult for women to express fully - there are too many societal constraints holding them back. i'd like to secure a space wherein the woman feels safe to express her true nature.  although i love to travel, i also like to relax at home, maybe trying out a new dessert recipe or two. i often share my culinary attempts with my friends, and would be happy to let you sample them as well!"}, {"age": "38", "status":

message me, why include the fact that you failed my \"message me if\" in your first message? i guess it's a boon to me, since it makes it easier to screen out the people i don't want to go on a date

almost having an accent or almost being well endowed, or almost preferring open relationships. 2) poor grammar. 3) there are 7 available points.  \"how do i tell if im well endowed?\"  -the bad grammar alone is a turn off. but to answer this boy's question, you could measure and compare yourself to the general population, length and width. but probably if you have to ask, that means you aren't.  \"i want to suck your pussy until you cum on my face.\"  -while i like sex, i tend to get very turned off by messages that are explicitly sexual. i think it's very presumptuous. just because i like sex does not automatically mean that i wish to have sex with you. meeting for a few drinks to get to know each other is a good start on the road to getting in my pants, but if the chemistry's not there it just won't happen. also, this particular message (from a man) arrogantly presumes he already knows how to pleasure me. perhaps all pussies are the same to him?  \"i bet your over-sexed facade gets you lot's of messages.\"  -is this a come on? did you message me because you want a date, or just to be mean? if the former, does this technique ever work? if the latter, why? this is probably the cruelest message i've received. it assumes 1) i don't like sex. not sure why this person would make that assumption about anyone. perhaps he's a misogynist that believes women never like

that i could only meet that special someone organically through shared interests and that internet dating was great for other people but not right for me. but, as i continue to meet happy couples who have discovered each other online i had to ask myself why i couldn't be one of those 'other people'.  sohere it goes  with either friends or romantic interests, i believe that you do people a disservice by not being honest and forthright with them. i appreciate that type of integrity and transparency in return and it has proven itself to be a valuable 'sniff test'. this probably explains why i don't like to stew over things so you'll never have to second guess what i'm thinking or feeling. it's also useful if i somehow didn't notice the hem of my skirt didn't quite make its way all the way down my backside before i walked out of a public restroom.  i'm less interested in what job you have or what titles you hold and more interested in what you do in your free time and what things we could enjoy doing together. maybe we spend the winter skiing at as many different locations as we can? how many trails or national parks can we hike over a summer? maybe you can help me put those surf lessons to good use or accompany me with whatever instrument you play while i put my guitar lessons to good use?  i realized when i reread my 'what i'm doing with my life' section that because i do a lot of outdoor activities, it could give someone the impression that i dress mostly in cotton and carry my wallet in the back pocket of my jeans. but, with the exception of running errands or rolling out of bed on a weekend to the nearest greasy spoon for brunch, i was raised to \"give 'em something nice to look at\" when you leave the house.  there is nothing like disappointment to remind you that you're living and, no doubt, if you're breathing you've experienced it. i hope that how i've handled and grown from it differentiates me from the masses and that it comes in useful when you need someone to help get you through a bad day by having an ice bucket of beers and a foot massage waiting for you when you get home.  some of the questions on this website make me shiver but, with the person i trust, no question is too private. i am reserved when necessary and expressive and uninhibited when appropriate.  a little bit about you: your quiet confidence allows you to command attention from a room without demanding it and you appreciate that presence in your match. your discretion, humility and intuition tell you that it takes much more than a pretty face and a couple of things in common to create a relationship and your search for 'the one' may have even made you feel, at times, like she doesn't actually exist. but you know it's right when you've found someone who can finish your sentences for you because you're so tuned in to each other and entire conversations ensue using the secret language that you invented together.  you find beauty in internal qualities, aren't ruled by precise, physical requirements and realize that chemistry is an happy accident. you trust that things will happen as they may and open yourself up to it, freely.",

gentleman. a man with class that walks in with a classy, stunning , sensual woman is a man to be desired.  when i think of my perfect match i think of what my friend wrote, \"find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot (so never call me hot, cutie, doll or anything alike), who calls you back when you hang up on him (i would never hang up on someone), who will lie under the stars and listen to your heartbeat, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep or snore ;) ... wait for the man who kisses your forehead, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who holds your hand in front of his friends, who thinks you' re just as beautiful without makeup on. one who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares and how lucky he is to have you... the one who turns to his friends and says, that's her......\" the only thing i would add to this would be that he would always be a gentleman, be able to communicate no matter what the circumstances are and be respectful.

door for men. also, i believe that we are what we surround ourselves with. yes, i cook, clean, do laundry and i enjoy movies as well as the theater. i love art and have a collection of it. i'm comfortable in my workout clothes, jeans or a little black dress and high heels and when i wear my heels i expect you to be much taller than me. :). smile, i like to be thrown around on the dance floor. what were you thinking? ;) if you can't run circles around me we are not a match. you can lie all you want but the truth finally comes to light and do you want to be remembered as someone who had to lie to get his way? if your mother brought you up right you won't want to be remembered as anything else but a gentleman.  i'd like to be best friends. ;) life is too short to sit home and ponder about the past or things we have no control over. i'm nice to the waitress and gardener. you'll quickly find out that i love to joke around and i'm very talkative. there is a time and a place to be egotistical and mean so if you believe that you need to show those qualities while you're trying to get to know someone you've got a problem. yes, i can be as intelligent as the dr. next door and use those big words that some would need a dictionary to understand but i'd rather speak to you in simple words. you may laugh with me but not at me or at my expense. :)  i'm not interested in a long distance relationship and a gentleman will never ask a lady to meet him half way or to come meet him in his neck of the woods. if you like to travel and are interested in driving my way i have no objection in getting to know you.  my opinion of being with just one person is based on the beauty that comes with giving my all to him and feeling beautiful about it. many friends have mentioned how

out from fear and anxiety. and although i have worked hard to semi eradicate my straight white boy roots, i have maintained my midwestern values. i did a 10 year stint in sw louisiana where i experienced major cultural shock followed by transformative assimilation. i gained a modicum of rhythm two stepping in honky tonks, a love of all things spicy and i owned a fighting cock for a couple of weeks. i built log cabins high in the colorado rockies using mostly hand tools and a clydesdale. i abandoned my overt hippyness in a cave somewhere above aspen. then i moved here and spent many a night in gay dance clubs where i picked up great dance moves and helpful fashion tips. i still love to go dancing, to whatever is on the turn table. i call my style \"homo hipster\" cuz it sounds

construction management business but i have an agreement with my friend that if he ever catches me in a pair of pleated kaki dockers, he'll cut my legs off. i was previously a construction manager to

stressful. i even have some mad farmer skills which i can demonstrate with my backyard vegetable boxes and the shade garden i recently planted.  i have a very active, sometimes dark and completely irreverent sense of humor. it runs in the family. but it's never mean spirited, unless i am in good company. i am constantly laughing my stupid ass off. for the eehors of the world, it can be a little disconcerting at times. needless to say i do not take myself too seriously.  i approach almost everything in my life as an opportunity for creativity whether it be clothing or building a bicycle. i fashion \"art\" light fixtures out of weird stuff. and i have few things around my house i've done and i call art. i always have some art project kicking around in my head. and i really would like to

challenging, but so far i think it's the best decision i've made in a while. learning about other people and how to help them enjoy their lives is something i am very happy to be doing, especially after a long time at a job that was mostly mind-numbing.  let's see, some other things about me: i am a straightforward person who is capable of having an intelligent conversation just as much as i am able to talk about how amazing van damme movies in the 80s were (ps - he totally appears in breakin 2). i am mostly vegetarian, which means i have been teaching myself to cook more and more, but am still tempted by the occasional burger or bacon. i have my reasons. and don't worry, i don't feel the need to talk about them all the time. i like chilling at home with movies just as much as i like going out to a bar for drinks. i still believe machete was robbed of an oscar nomination. i regularly enjoy movie nights with friends, and pub trivia, though i maintain i am actually not that great at pub trivia. i last helped my team by knowing that ray of light was the album madonna released in 1998 and that the thinker was sculpted by rodin. though i might seem like a tough cookie, i'm also soft-hearted to those close to me. i enjoy simple things like cooking dinner with somebody, just as much as i enjoy doing something random like dancing on the field of att park. i am pretty sure evidence of that is on youtube. and no, i didn't run on the field, i actually performed a choreographed routine with a group. i think i'd make a good \"straight man\" for any comedy duo, but i am pretty horrible at remembering jokes. i enjoy wine, but i probably cannot really tell you what a tannen is, and it is probably because if the wine tastes good, i'm not sure i really care what a tannen is. at various times in my life, i have been a drummer, a college radio dj, and an entrepreneur. i have worked for big corporations, startups, small businesses, and nonprofits. they all come with their own unique benefits and challenges. i enjoy \"trashy\" easy reads, and pepper in some classic literature and nonfiction (generally having to do with food/capitalism/culture). i am pretty up for trying new things, but not as up for it if it involves me being cold, because i am originally from phoenix and i likes the heat.  school and work keep me pretty busy, but, especially now that it is summer, i am loving hosting bbqs in my back yard, hitting up the local fairs, going wine tasting, kayaking, and running the lake (to get ready for a zombie mud run later this summer).  i guess i'm

am a mom with 2 kids, 1 is 22 and has moved back in with me to get on his feet(living in my place in san antonio), the other is a sophomore in college in ky. i was a transplant to ky from the chicago suburbs and now live in san antonio, tx (i am in san francisco on a travel assignment and thinking of relocating permanently to the area.) i don't smoke, i socially drink but don't get drunk, no drugs for this girl, i don't cheat. i am not into the club scene at all but will hit a local spot for live music on occasion. my most favorite way to spend my time off of work is being outdoors. i am much more comfortable in a pair of hiking boots and a pair of khakis than i am in a dress. i do clean up well and am able to play the part of a girly girl if i really have to...sigh. i love to laugh and have fun. i would really like to meet someone that would like to show me around the northern california area. now that the kids are pretty much grown i am ready to have some fun and meet others and enjoy life. i have a strong relationship with the lord. i love to volunteer and help others in need. i try to be christ like in my daily life, but of course being a human being, i usually fall short somewhere during the day...thank god for his never ending grace and mercy...without it i would be in big trouble. as for my schedule i work 12 hour shifts which vary from start times of 10a-3p. in my current position i have to work varied weekend shifts as well. i usually only work 3 shifts a week, unless i decide to work overtime, which leaves me with 4 days off a week. if my supervisor isn't being a turd i also get some long stretches off (6-7 days in a row) great for taking trips. so if you are looking for a 9-5/m-f kinda girl, that's not me. well that's all i have for now...anything else you want to know just ask.  deal breakers: 1. smoking 2. lots of swearing 3. a guy's night out is spent checking out other women and/or strip clubs 4. por@@graphy so please don't waste our time

god and a good person  the good person: wow! all this time i didn't think you were real... my bad. but i was a \"good person\", so i guess it's all good, right? god: no, it's not \"all good\" the good person: ha ha, i know you're kidding... i mean it's not like i was hitler or anything, i was a good person, and went out of my way to help... most of the time. god: i'm not laughing .. in fact your rejection of me makes me extremely sad. the good person: okay, okay... i'm sorry.. but come on.. i went to church. god: you went a few times, but never invited me into your heart ... by the way: your aunt nancy, the one who i brought home last year... the one who tried to open your heart to me... she says hello.. she's hangs out in my throne room with me every day. the good person: aunt nancy? the weird jesus freak? ah, she was so annoying... always wanting me to pray with her... come on, you have to admit, she was just a little weird, right? god: excuse me! i happen to love her passion about the gift of my son... you know, i sent him to die for everyone... this included you. this was my son... my only son... i sent him to suffer for you. i sent him to endure the most painful death imaginable, for you. and yet, you rejected every single invitation. the good person: i was just joking, you know that... you're god, right? god: i am god. a reality you clearly rejected until you met me face to face. and, i know your heart... i know what you call \"a joke\" was really an attempt to justify your rejection of me. the good person: so i messed up... ok, i'm sorry... don't you forgive people like me? god: i gave you every resource imaginable to accept the gift of my son while you were alive, but you rejected him... you rejected the cross.... i gave you my word, the bible, the ultimate instruction manual, and you choose to listen only to those who would try to disprove it -- but never could. i told you how i created everything, but you choose to place more faith in coming from nothing, a \"big bang\"... i mean seriously... you thought you came from nothing? you tried to publicly undermine the significance of my son by repeatedly demeaning my followers by referring to them as \"freaks\" or \"holy rollers\" and a whole host of other names. you always knew in your heart that there was a something more to life, but you never thought i was important enough to seek out. i told you through your aunt nancy to give up the ways of the world -- they would lead to nowhere, but you laughed at her and chose to embrace worldly behaviors, without reservation.... and i know about each one of them. you supported causes that rejected me, and then you turned around and cursed, mocked and blamed me when things didn't work out. .... unfortunately, you became your own god, of

takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at something and i easily got that in the 7 years that i was a taxi driver/ tour guide in beautiful ski town. i owned my own business showing people a good time on their vacation. i was very good at this and it left me with a very unique set of skills, and idiosyncrasies.  for instance, i respect time and timing, and have learned to play with them quite well while keeping peoples schedules and positive experiences flowing. in the money earning context, this equated to large and consistent tips, in the flirting context, lots of laughter and mirth and in the dating realm lots of great .... relationships!  ha! you probably thought i was going to say sex. which is awesome, but its not really all that i am after at this stage in my life. i think sex is pretty much a given in this day and age and pretty darned easy if one were to have loose standards or let their hormones run wild. so in a weird way, there is a leveling of the playing field between men and women in regards to sex.  what i am most interested in is, finding a partner that is passionate about co-creating a relationship that works. one that is based on trust, passion, compassion, forgiveness and of course fun. these, i think, are learned skills and are more of a practice than a personality trait.  since i left that beautiful ski town, i have been very involved in learning who i am as a person and figuring out what works/doesn't work and being responsible for being the best me that i can be. its been very transformative, challenging, inspiring, healing and fun. especially, since i have been able to travel, create and express myself in ways i never imagined.  now that i moved to san fransisco, i feel like i have a clean slate to build my new life, make new friends and grow that special relationship into a life together.  writing a profile is weird for me because i am conditioned to get to know people in person in a taxi or other non-significant context. more importantly i had to learn how to break the ice with them instantly so that we would both be comfortable with being in the same vehicle together.  imagine for yourself the social challenges and boundary issues of having strange people in your own car. how good would your judge of character be after thousands of opportunities to practice? from personal experience, energy, chemistry, affinity are all in-person experiences and impossible to get across in a profile accurately. or is it? hopefully, i am wrong and you are already clicking that message button.", "essay1": "i am settling in to san fransisco. i just moved into a new place or rather, i have been setting my place up to work in harmony with my professional, personal plans. i have a mindless job that will pay the rent, enhance my social life and finally launch a project that i have been committed to for several years.  having time to do the things that i love is the most important thing to me and i spent the last 2 years positioning myself to have my finances in order so that i can avoid the pitfalls that most couples encounter, not spending enough time with each other because they are working so much and arguing about money.  a committed relationship is very important to me. i found that the love, stability and energy that comes from having a partner makes me more capable at accomplishing the goals that i have set out for myself personally, which includes having a healthy, strong relationship. now i am not perfect and relationships do take a certain amount of effort, but i do know that love is a skill and its my responsibility to transform myself to be the best lover that i can be. this however requires good communication on both our parts. to this end i am committed to what works for us as a couple and in particular finding ways to synchronize our lives to be more synergistic. i have found that play, dance, singing and humor are a great place to start but the real magic occurs when we are safe enough to be vulnerable. i know its scary but i can't imagine a life without it and i want to have that with my mate.  it feels strange writing this, but i have been inspired by the profiles that are honest and authentic. so i will be honest. i want to explore the ocean of emotion with someone special. i want to play and surf along its shores, and when the time is right set sail to distant lands where the risk is great but the reward are greater.", "essay2": "thinking out of the box, looking at the world in a unique way and saying exactly the right thing at the right time. listening to

fit into any of the stereotypes that might be applied. my self-identity comes from within, grown over the years and experiences i've been through. it continues to develop as i wander my way through the phases of my life.  i grew up as a pretty clueless, sheltered, rural kid in vermont. i was cured of that by a year spent as a afs high school exchange student in new zealand. i've lived on the west coast well over a decade ago mostly in portland, oregon, and now i'm in the east bay area across from san francisco.  overseas and long-term travel is something i've done a bit, mostly outdoor/backpacking type trips. after my year in nz i got the travel bug, and i've been back there 4 times since. i've also done extended trips taking me to places like the nepal himalayas, the scottish highlands, the patagonian andes, and tropical thai beaches. on this continent i've done a few long-distance solo bicycle touring trips ranging from a week to 4 months, and i've spent plenty of time hiking and backpacking in the cascades and other western mountains.  i experience a lot of joy in being the world, learning about it, and seeing how it's interconnected. one of my strongest urges is to share that joy with people i care about. unfortunately when i was younger this sometimes made me seem like a know-it-all. gladly i've mostly outgrown that, but if i get comfortable knowing someone, i can still occasionally overflow with a bit too much authoritative-sounding information.  i've been openly gay since my early 20s, but i've never fit in with the urban gay culture or the \"bear\" label that is often applied to me because of my body type. i see my orientation as an important, but not defining, aspect of myself. the gay-straight spectrum of my friends seems to mirror that of the populace. that said, i'm most attracted to other guys who are self-aware, independent, and aren't really connected to that culture. i tend towards guys who are smaller than me with average builds, and generally younger than me (late 20s-30s), at least in attitude and personality, if not physical age. i guess that's because i spent so much of my life working at colleges. oh facial and body hair are also very nice ;-)  here's few more factoids to give you a deeper glimpse at the inner boy: - didn't own a car for 16 years, and now that i do, its an old vw camper van which i don't drive as often as i should for it's health. - haven't watched broadcast tv since the 80s. - even as a little kid, i liked to read encyclopedias for fun. - was at everst base camp in '96, a few weeks before the events described in \"into thin air\" - i am a burner. - raising a family is still a desire, but not by myself. - i have some rather unusual musical instruments in my home. hammered dulcimer, baritone ukulele, tinwhistles. - i can sort-of play them too!  i am self-defined, unexpected, and furry", "essay1": "i do computery things at a very fun place. i spend my work day making

understand why the question's there, so here's a few things that i like better than other things.  books - hmm, mostly non-fiction but good fiction is wonderful too. some things currently on my small bookshelf: the name of the rose, dante's divine comedy, ishmael, the nag hammadi library, the complete dune series, the definitive biography of pdq bach, the essential rumi, peoples history of the us, way of the peaceful warrior, the omnivores dilemma, and lots of cookbooks.  movies - anything thats engaging and tells a decent story, here's a few: chocolat, dogma, batman begins, babette's feast, spring summer fall winter and spring, aladdin, fargo, shortbus, tampopo, the iron giant, rabbit proof fence, anything from pixar.  music - i like a very eclectic mix, everything from bach to the boards of canada, from aesop rock to the beatles to pink martini to edith piaf. from gregorian chant to idm and dub. i generally avoid heavy, agressive, dark, or angry music since i'm none of those (ok, maybe i'm a little heavy...) i'm also content with, and sometimes prefer, just the ambient sounds around me.  food - basically everything :-) how about... sauteed pea shoots with ginger garlic

to open your heart and take a chance on love or you will be alone and continue to make excuses why you haven't met the perfect guy. \"he doesn't match my check list, we have nothing in common.\" these things don't matter. all that matters is two people willing to give eachother a chance and love eachother.  i'm looking for someone that can come over often. or if they live close i could come see them.  i love my cat. i like watching tv. i like video games. i like talking to people on irc chat. i'm smart, kind, and down to earth. i'm probably the most accepting guy you'll ever meet. i believe everyone should be treated equally. i don't judge anyone. i treat everyone with respect. i like people to be honest and themselves. theres no point in just being like everyone else. i used to be a singer in rock bands so i like to sing. karaoke is fun cause they appreciate anyone whos halfway decent. i have a purple belt in shito-ryu karate. i like tennis, bowling, pool, swimming, the beach, board games, card games, and fishing. i am originally from the boston area.  who i'd like to meet: someone who likes me for me, has a heart of gold, a great personality, is giving, nice, beautiful inside and out, understanding, non-judgemental, down to earth, someone who is like me, honest, someone i can be myself around, someone i can say anything to, someone who is ok with a skinny guy, someone not superficial or materialistic, someone who is patient, someone who wants to get to know me, someone who wants to be my friend.  music alternative, rock. judybats, bettie serveert,

to talking to women in bars and other things  before we begin, let's consider two basic points about women's (a) needs and (b) communication styles.  first, (a) women's needs:   women need security and women need to feel attractive. they need it, like men need approval. no psychobabble, it's just true.  secondly, (b) women's communication styles:   men communicate by demonstrating their accomplishments. this demonstrates their prowess and garners approval. listen to men talk: sports stats, their knowledge of movies, music, politics, their possessions, i did this, i did that, etc.,   women communicate to establish intimacy. i'm not sure why, cause i'm not a woman, but it's true. listen to them talk. they give all these details that seem so irrelevant. this is what i was wearing, and then janine said... and every guy wants to yell, get to the fuckin' point!! however, these details are not irrelevant to them. they are attempting to establish intimacy. so listen or at least look like you're listening. it's not important to a woman that her story is important to you. it's important that she feels like you know it's important to her.  please remember these two points: (a) women need security and they need to feel attractive and (b) they communicate to establish intimacy. this is as much a part of women as a strong pitching staff is to the new york yankees. curb your own communication style toward these two points and you will prosper. ignore these two points at your own risk.  okay, let's begin.  first off, don't use lines. can i buy you a drink? do you have the time? are those space-pants? cause your ass is out of this world! lines are stupid. you're a stud, you don't need lines.  be yourself. if you are a loud, funny, crazy guy, go with that. if you are shy and quiet, go with that. the more comfortable you are the better off you are.  now, go to the bar with a group of friends. you have strength and numbers, you show that you have a life, plus you need to take a wingman if you're going to talk to a woman who is not alone.  now, when you see the girl of choice, try to make a little eye contact, if you can. she's already noticed every guy in the place, just like you've noticed every cute girl. don't stand by, staring and drooling, if you she doesn't notice you after a short while (about the amount of time it takes you to slowly and calmly finish your drink), go over to her.  now, before you do, you must say these words to yourself and you must believe them 100%. i don't need this woman, and if i get shot down, so what, she probably has crabs.  try it now, just to yourself (make sure your co-workers/roommates aren't watching), i don't need this women, and if i get shot down, so what, she probably has crabs.  try it again, i don't need this women, and if i get shot down, so what, she probably has crabs.  and believe it. whether or not some chick in a bar likes you is meaningless. if she rejects you, it is completely inconsequential in the grand scheme of your life. you're a stud, trust me.  now, walk up to her and say, hi. i'm insert your name.' (shake her hand firmly, but don't be brutish; you probably outweigh her by fifty pounds). either she will say, so. or she will say, hi, i'm insert her name.' if she says, so, or anything comparable, shrug and walk away. she probably has crabs.  okay, so she tells you her name. now what? if she has a boring name (e.g. jen, maria, karen) don't say, wow, what a great name! but if her name is exotic, (margarita, ezmerelda, charlie), give her a very laid back comment. great name or that's pretty. don't gush. every other guy gushes. just a simple compliment will do.  if she has crazy hair or shiny blue eyes or some feature that looks like every guy has commented on it, don't say anything. please. if all goes well, you'll have plenty of time to compliment them another time.  now say, ezmerelda, how are you doing, tonight? sounds simple right? it is.  are you having a good night? if she says no, say, oh, that's too bad, i hope your night gets better. it was nice meeting you. cheers. leave. you do not need to get mixed up with someone like that. she either wants to be left alone or she's looking for pity. you don't need any pity cases, especially, pity cases with crabs. (no, she doesn't have actual crabs. it's a metaphor and if you haven't figured that out by now, then you probably have crabs.) :-)  if she says, yes, then you're in  here's how simple it is. here's how you talk to women, right here, right now...  you say, great. me too. my buddies and i are just kicking back after a great day of ____________.  (of course, you actually need to do something with your life.) (if all you do is play video games or watch movies or wrestle your monkey, you're fucked. you need more help then i can give.)  so what do you do with your life, stud? if you do outdoor stuff, say, after a great day of hiking. do you go to the beach? after a great day at the beach. hell, did you go out for lunch? say, after a great, laid back saturday. the idea is that you did something. and whatever you did, it was great. you are someone who enjoys life, you are setting the stage for intimacy and you are offering an emotion: enjoyment.  now here's the catch, she already knows whether you've got a shot. if you've gotten this far, she will either respond one of two ways. she will either respond with enthusiasm or she will not.  if she responds with enthusiasm (i.e., by asking questions), describe your day with the same degree of enthusiasm. if she is psyched, you be psyched. if she is mellow, you be mellow. then before you exhaust the topic, you switch gears. you ask her how her weekend, day, whatever, is going. if she volunteers the info, great, she's talking and beginning her own establishment of intimacy. and as we all know, that's what she needs.  (if she is not enthusiastic or interested, then she is not interested. at this point, say well, it was nice to meet you, excuse yourself, walk away, she probably has crabs, etc.)  i know it sounds trite, but what i really dislike about some people (not just women) is when they fail to ask questions and just talk about themselves.  keep her talking, ask her question and after question after question. don't talk about yourself. nothing is as boring to a woman as you. if she wants to know about you, she will ask. the only time you talk, besides asking the questions, is to relate a comparable story. but at this point, you direct the conversation by asking her questions and letting her establish intimacy.  if the conversation starts to stagnate, here are some basic questions to remember?  1. what kind of music do you like? a favorite artist/group? 2. are you from this area originally? 3. what kind of movies are you into? a favorite kind of movie? favorite movie? 4. what do you do for a living? 5. hobbies? 6. family? 7. do you travel? where would you go, if you could?*  *(number 7 is especially good. all women love travel and all women love fantasy. where would you go? is super. of course, don't use number 7 right away. build up to it and then, bang!)  now, you have to close the deal. when it feels right, say, let's get together some time. don't ask her. tell her. it's more natural. and she will like the confidence. if she especially liked you opener, ask her if she would like to join you the next time you're going to do it. or just ask her out to dinner. or a night on the town or the theatre or jesus, anything you and she would enjoy together.  (don't suggest anything for a first date that you don't want to do. the ballet will most likely bore the pants off of you. you'll get irritated, you'll get anxious and your first date will be your last. go to the park or have a picnic or something mutually enjoyable.)  great, let me have your phone number and i'll give you a call. that's it. you're done. now, if you say you are going to call, then call. women hate liars like every other team hates the world champion new york yankees.  so to recap:  1. be yourself. 2. hi, 3. how are you? 4. great, i (me and my buddies) are just kicking back after a great day of 5. questions, questions, questions 6. let's get together  and remember those seventeen magic words, \"i don't need this woman, and if i get shot down, so what, she probably has crabs.\"  so, there you go. that's how you talk to women. good luck.  p.s. to all you women reading this, i know there will be some, stop with the fucking expectations and self-deprecation in you ads.  1. if love is gonna happen, it will happen. you can't force it, no matter how loud your biological clock is ticking. meet the guy. talk to him. see what happens.  2. fat chick looking for love so what, i'm not a supermodel. i'm not into casual sex or any sex or ahhhh!!!! calm down, girl. you are not as ugly as you think you are. in fact, whether you are overweight or not, i'm sure you're probably a lot cuter than you think you are. if stats are an issue for you, don't put it in your ad. the reason men are not responding is not because you are, in your own words, fat, its cause you sound like you hate yourself. nobody, man or women, wants to be around a negative person. it's okay. you are okay. really.  p.s.s. while i'm ranting, women men do not expect you to look like supermodels!!! we think it would be nice if you did, but we don't expect it. when a man is alone with a woman, she is beautiful. she is there. she is real. she smells and tastes and sounds real. and that is beautiful.  god bless you crazy people.  maybe we're supposed to meet the wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift.  maybe when the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us.  maybe the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had. men can have a complete conversation and have it be a total of five words in as many hours.  maybe it is true that we don't know what we have got until we lose it but it is also true that we don't know what we have been missing until it arrives.  giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they will love you back. don't expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their heart; but if it does not, be content it grew in yours.  it takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.  don't go for looks; they can deceive. don't go for wealth; even that fades away. go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. find the one that makes your heart smile.  there are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real.  dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.  always put yourself in others' shoes. if you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too. the happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.  happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives.  love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a tear. the brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches.  when you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. live your life so that when you die, you are the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.", "essay1": "ummm things... good things... always good things.", "essay2": "a few good things and a few bad things. i know a little about a lot and a lot about a little.", "essay3": "intelligence, wit, cunning...", "essay4": "i'll read almost anything. i like convoluted stories... spy, mystery, even music like that.. jazz, classical, rock", "essay5": "i can and have done without most things and can do so again if i really had to.", "essay6": "existential motivation, dharma, pink floyd, obstructionism, value-added living", "essay7": "what i am. i'm a sailor man.", "essay8": "i'm not as smart as i'm perceived to be, but i'm probably smarter than your average bear.  also, this has been my favorite poem for a while.  my heart trembles like a poor leaf. the planets whirl in my dreams. the stars press against my window. i rotate in my sleep. my bed is a warm planet.", "essay9": "you appreciate someone who is multi-talented, unlimited, careful, wild, safe, sane, probing, questioning, collaborative, and of course, if you're beautiful, witty, intelligent, and kind yourself."}, {"age": "31", "status": "single", "sex": "m", "orientation": "bisexual", "education": "graduated from masters program", "ethnicity": "white, other", "income": "-1", "job": "education / academia", "location": "berkeley, california", "essay0": "i'm a queer, radical, easily bored, interested in everything genderqueer ftm. i'm neither male nor bisexual, but that's the closest i could get. i do not wear rainbows nearly as often as the profile pic would suggest.  i am not looking for new serious emotional commitments. i am looking for casual hookups, fun flings and/or mild adventures with cute, emotionally intelligent people. in other words i don't want a lot from you emotionally - but i want it to be really good.  i mostly go for queer masculine-ish people who have interesting genders.

things that constantly remind you of how beautiful you are (even when you don't feel like it) and what you mean to me. i've been told that my style of affection envelops like a cozy blanket and warms the soul on a cold day.  i think one of the things that sets me apart and could even be considered a liability is that i'm not obsessed with sports... football, baseball, basketball, nascar... whatever. being a sports fan is just not that big of a deal to me.  however, when i was younger i played soccer for 8 years (mvp for 3) and trained in martial arts for 10 years.  i do like to stay in shape and work out regularly (i've had less than 7% body fast the majority of my life), but i'm not obsessed with my appearance, diet, any of that.  ultimately, i'd like to find someone i'd rather not be without. so if you have an absurd sense of humor, curious about the world, like to think outside the box, passionate, driven, affectionate and warm? then we might have something to talk about. you

development. probably my favorite show of all time. i love parks and rec, the office, 30 rock and futurama as well. i also really like law and order: svu for some reason. i can also quote most friends episodes line for line. watching that show with me is probably pretty annoying.  for music, i like punk-y things, sometimes with some metal. i'm a huge fan of pop punk, but i also like some hardcore, metalcore and some prog rock. i also really like electronica music, and i'll listen to dubstep if i'm in the right mood. my dad was a huge fan of blue grass and folk, so i have a deep appreciation for those genres on music. i just don't ever really think to listen to them. i figure i will when i grow up more. i listen to music constantly through out the day. my last.fm can tell you that. it's a very big part of who i am and what i like. oh, and i think kanye west is the greatest hip hop artist of all time. in terms of complete package (his rapping ability, his lyrical skill and depth, his beat creating ability, his knowledge about when to use guest performers, and his production skill), there isn't another person as good as him. i've gotten into way too many heated arguments about this, but i feel like i should say it. i happen to like hip hop that is pretty poppy and over the top arrogant.  i love all kinds of food. i use to be a picky eater as a child, and boy was i wrong. i love mexican food, the spicier, the better. i also love chinese, vietnamese and some thai. but i also really enjoy an in and out burger. and mcdonalds chicken mcnuggets. i'm a sucker for those. i can cook for myself pretty well, and i enjoy a huge range of all kinds of food.", "essay5": "i think i could do without most things. i mean, i could survive. but here's 6 things i really like having: 1.

"location": "emeryville, california", "essay0": "(i apologize for the length of this summary, i sometimes over explain things and just couldn't leave anything out) \"and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make\" the above line is my favorite quote of all time because it's how i try and live my life. while i'm far from perfect, it's an ideal that i strive for. i'm a college graduate with a history major and i'm trying to find my way in life. i currently work part time (but usually get full time hours) in retail, but am looking for bigger and better things. i've lived in the bay area for just over a year now and have enjoyed my time up here so far. people generally think of me as a nice guy (i've been accused of being too nice by some). i tend not to take myself too seriously. i've got a good sense of humor and can be sarcastic when the occasion calls for it. i'm honest and fairly straight forward. i can be loyal to a fault. i'm a bit of a hopeless romantic, chivalrous, generous and look to help others when possible. i'm fairly laid back and am not quick to anger. when you first meet me, i will come off as a shy guy, but once i get to know someone, i open up a lot and go from being an introvert to a bit of an extrovert. i've also been accused of being a smartass, which i tend to agree with, i do think that my behind is quite brilliant. i love animals, but i'm definitely a dog person. i do like cats, however, i am allergic to some. i'm a hard worker and hate to be late, but i also love to kick back. i'm a geek, and enjoy sci-fi and fantasy, with the original star wars trilogy being my favorite movies (followed very closely by the princess bride). i'm a gamer and enjoy playing with others as well as alone. i also enjoy reading comics. i'm a bit of an oddity, i was born and raised in socal, and am about as much of a hardcore hockey fan as you can find (and no, my family isn't canadian). the anaheim ducks are my favorite team, but i'll watch any team play if i have the time, hockey is just an amazing sport to watch. i'm also incredibly excited that the echl will be moving a hockey team to san francisco starting next season! i love to read, and lose countless hours of sleep to it every week. i enjoy playing ultimate frisbee and soccer, but i haven't played much of either one lately. i'm always up for tossing a disc around with a friend. i enjoy going to movies, and get groups together to go to midnight showings whenever possible. there are times when i enjoy the company of an animal (usually a dog, but cats and others sometimes as well) more than the company of a person. this happens for 1 of 2 reasons. first of all, i communicate well with dogs and most tend to really like me. second, when i'm really down, there are few things that bring a smile back to my face like when i'm playing with a dog. for you movie and tv fans, there are a few characters that i identify with decently to fairly well. they range from luke to mal to simon to castle to westley to perrin (bonus points if you know who every single one of these characters are). basically, a couple of farmboys combined with a difficulty in talking to girls combined with a hopeless romantic combined with an odd sense of honor and loyalty.", "essay1": "figuring out what comes next and trying to enjoy what i have right now. also, i'm planning on winning the lottery

hear about people who think they can't do without a person and take action.  yes, there are technically substances that i actually can't do without: air, water, food, salts, etc. it seems some people

i'm deprived of any of them, i'll adjust and cope and find i may enjoy something new. that's living.  so, finally, here are the six things i would like to keep in my life: - the company of family and friends: i love being social, throwing the party, doing fun things with fun people. - access to nature: hiking, biking, skiing, swimming, running naked down an abandoned beach at sunset, etc. - art: music, tattoos, sidewalk chalk, belly dancing, weird cars. - something to tinker with: i drive an aforementioned weird car (a tiger-striped '73 vw thing) which is part art, part puzzle, all fun. -

snapshot, or perhaps even a zoom-in view of myself and my world. i do this knowing that there is no substitute for what happens in real life - you know, like when two people are close enough to actually sense each other. i do know that engaging in live, two-way conversation feels much more real to me than describing myself to you this way, but here goes.  my friends describe me as passionate, playful, expressive, and adventurous. i'm all about my next adventure and i have a big appetite for life. i aim for a combination of routine and spontaneity in my day to day. i'm fortunate to posses a natural buoyancy toward life. i've cultivated that by being pretty vigilant about watching my mind and not necessarily believing the stories it likes to generate. there's often quite a gap between 'story' and 'reality'. as byron katie likes to say: \"reality is always kinder than the story we tell ourselves about it.\"  i get along great with kids because i still have a lot of kid left inside me, but i have also graduated to full adult-hood. i pay my bills on time and don't make too many messes in life. (well maybe some intentional ones, like when i'm finger painting with chocolate pudding) if i like something, more is good, if not, there's plenty else to try. i love being a girl and all that it entails. whether that means dressing up for a special event, or having full access to my emotions, i wouldn't trade it. having a reason to dress up is a big pleasure, i also like a day in my pj's every now and then.  i especially enjoy the unique polarity of masculine and feminine, it's such a rich and unique alchemy. what i'm drawn to in a a man is his quiet confidence and his depth of presence. someone who's comfortable enough in himself that he doesn't need to pretend, posture, or impress, but can simply be the man that he is. secure enough that when he's feeling something he can share it honestly. at home in his body and naturally affectionate. extra plus if you're familiar with tantra and/or taoist practice.  my vision for my next relationship is one that is very dynamic, engaged, and a lot of fun. i'm drawn to connecting with those who are relatively free from the residue of their past so are free to live, act, and make decisions from today. we all have shadow, and one of it's favorite places to show itself is in deeper relationship, but when there is space to welcome that, and even curiosity about it, i find it moves along pretty quickly.  i keep discovering that what matters most, is less about what i'm getting, than how i'm contributing, and i strive to have a positive impact whenever i can. i'm definitely an extrovert since i really enjoy people, i also need some down time to hang with myself.  although i love children, i'm probably not looking to have any, but i sure like playing with them. i wouldn't rule out relationship with you if you're a

exudes a passion for life and who \"gets\" me and my idiosyncrasies.  i thought i'd list some random things about me in hope that they give you a better idea about who you are dealing with:  - i only sleep on the left side of the bed and on my right side. i have tried other combinations but that's the only one that works well. - i own 3 passports, one of which is completely useless and yet i have a soft side for itmaybe because i always cheer for the underdog. - i have a slight addiction for french dark chocolate. some people bring wine back from their trip to france, i bring dark chocolate. it's lighter and this way i can pack more shoes and handbags i'm pragmatic with my addictions. - i enjoy washing dishes (even though i have a dishwasher). it's very weird but i find that sensual. i love the foam! - i hate putting dishes away - i'll never vote republican in this lifetime. i don't have it in me no matter what amount of taxes democrats make me pay. - i am athletic and i enjoy different types of sports: i play tennis, snowboard, run regularly, do yoga and would like to get back into kite surfing i have a good disposition for sports somehow, maybe because i was a tomboy as a child (i have 2 older brothers, that says it all) and there is still a bit of daredevil in me after all these years. - i absolutely love being on a sail boatanywhere in the worldi'm usually the designated cook for the crew. - i never watch sport on tv or in a stadium (unless it's an atp tennis tournament). - i hardly ever watch tv except for charlie rose and the bbc news. i knowboring but i love charlie. i only watch tv if i am going to learn something. therefore, i'm utterly ignorant about tv series or reality shows - i only drink nespresso coffee. i know i'm a snob. - i can prepare you a delicious french dinner if you are nice to me. the credit goes to my mom who is an exceptional cook. - i love music and dancing. all kinds of music. - i wish i played an instrument, specifically guitar or piano. i'm annoyed by the fact that i don't, aside from playing flute (!) as a childthanks mom, flute was really cool - i like men and women equally and i have great friends on both sides. but to be clear, i only like men romantically! - i'm a hopeless romantic still convinced to the core that the perfect guy (for me) is around the corner. - i was married for 9 years a while back so i have a pretty good idea about the meaning of the word commitment. - i have more kerastase products than most hair salons. i don't know what it is with me and hair products. the tantalizing smell maybe - talking about hair, i occasionally bring a puzzled look on people's face by switching from a straight (hair) classy look to my more natural and sassy curlsi like versatility. - i have a beautiful cat with a great personality. even non-cat lovers fall in love with her. butshe loves men a bit too much and i find myself competing with her for their attention! - i have no skeletons left in my closets. just a few bones here and there. sorry but i'm not perfect. working on it though - i believe in karma, the golden rule and the law of attraction. - like every one else, i'm a bit complex but not complicated. - i'm very feminine and sensual. - i'm fun to be around and for the most part always in a good mood. i'm the happiest i've ever been. - my indulgent friends say that i am warm, genuine and a caring soul. i'm apparently also inquisitive, subtly sexy, passionate about life, with a vibrant energy and an adventurous and positive spirit! - i love my family (they are all in france) and i have an unlimited supply of love for my nephew and niece. i visit them often. - i'm still very french despite the 18 years lived in the us but i'm very different from the french living in franceconfusing maybe but true. - i like smells, the good ones only - i'm running out of idea....", "essay1": "i'm working hard these days at living purposefully, with a clear intent as to what i
