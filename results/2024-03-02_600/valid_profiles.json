the unbeaten track that takes me to new awakenings in life. yes i know the above sounds cliche, but i actually live it! i was born to hippy parents on a commune in tenn. where my parents had taken a vow of poverty. when i was two months old my family moved to guatemala to help in the relief efforts after an earthquake killed over 30,000 people and orphaned over 100,000 children. we lived there for 4 years after which we moved to california where we settled for about 6 years. we continued to travel about the country, actually 36 states (8 months), branching out to countries like thailand (6 months) and mexico (2 months) in search of the perfect haven. my parents never found their ideal place, but settled on gainesville, florida where i was home schooled along with my older sister till i graduated. i left home at 19 to live and work in a community for mentally handicapped people in upstate new york for a year. i then moved to paris, france as an au pair for another year. it was while in paris i discovered my love for salsa dancing. i had been dancing folkloric dance since i was 10 so always had a passion for dance, but not quite the passion i developed for salsa. i've been salsa dancing for over 14 years now and the sound of cuban salsa still makes my blood boil. after paris i returned to california where i continued as a nanny for a couple years. i had yet to find my calling in life so settled on caring for other people's children. i finally got certified to become a personal chef and have since then run my own personal chef and catering business (13 years). having traveled so much growing up i have always appreciated other cultures through traveling, food, music, and photography. my love for food is great, though my passion for photography is even greater. after 4 years of studying photography i'm now balancing my cooking and photography career.  these are just a few things that make me tick.  i love, food, travel, community, photography, laughter, the flavor of water when parched, the sound of children giggling uncontrollably, a child's hug, sleeping under the stars, the milky way, swimming naked at night, sleeping naked, chivalry, pranking, water fights, the smell of camp fires, the scent of wet earth, romance, sea glass hunting on the beach, artichokes, oysters, crab season, my cat's meow, the sun, being outside at all hours on hot humid nights, cuba, salsa dancing, old weathered hands that have a story, hearts of palm, nerds (candy), sushi, a first kiss, sex, my friends, spooning, world issues, sound of rain at night, playing in the rain, cooking for loved ones, hearing people's stories, road trips, big and little adventures, camping, making others laugh, laughing at myself, snuggles, etc..  if you share any love for the above

answers to tough questions. you see complexity in most thing and want to explore it with me. - intact family unit - intellect, wit and formal education - pulling me out of my brain with some dance moves in the kitchen - irreverence and healthy skepticism - and maybe suitable contempt for genuinely bad people - having time for a relationship and it's a priority - you (and me!) liking your body...wouldn't say not to some good strong hands too - common sense and lots of it - you trusting me even though i need a lot of freedom > and you get that that still means i'm deeply committed to you - banter and word play - being well traveled (my definition includes having lived abroad, multiple continents and wanting to travel lots more) - coordinated, 30-40, >5'10\" (this height one is a solid line in the sand - i warned you if you're shorter and surprised when i don't get back to you. i also have no interest in an email debate on this subject - seems to be strangely irresistible for some) - you like to both dress up, dress down, smell great and get dirty - masculinity without chest thumping - low drama, high commitment to mutual problem-solving - lover of food - lots of friends - appreciates personal possessions off the floor - being challenged - generosity - you've been hurt/grieved to the point that it changed you and your life in fundamental ways - you're excited, rather than nervous, about finding that one special person...and this has probably not always been the case  boo-hiss (for me) on: - clinginess - mistrust - feeling inferior/low confidence - unfounded arrogance - being awkward (smiling, walking, holding things) - skinny or puffy-muscled - questionable hygiene - serious anxiety or depression - no life planning going on - closed to the idea of having

scale and hugely centralized economy, can hardly be seen in relation to any particular landscape or ecosystem; the more-than-human ecology with which it is directly engaged is the biosphere itself.

of our fellow species becoming extinct each month as a result of our civilization's excesses, we can hardly be surprised by the amount of epidemic illness in our culture, from increasingly severe immune dysfunctions and cancers to widespread psychological distress, depression...from an animistic perspective, the clearest source of all this distress, both physical and psychological, lies in the aforementioned violence needlessly perpetuated by our civilization on the ecology of the planet; only by alleviating the latter will we be able to heal the former. while this may sound at first like a simple statement of faith, it makes eminent and obvious sense as soon as we acknowledge our thorough dependence upon the countless other organisms with whom we have evolved. caught up in a mass of abstractions, our attention hypnotized by a host of human-made technologies that only reflect us back to ourselves, it is all too easy for us to forget our carnal inherence in a more-than-human matrix of sensations and sensibiliites. our bodies have formed themselves in delicate reciprocity with the manifold textures, sounds, and shapes of an animate earth- our eyes have evolved in subtle interaction with other eyes, as our ears are attuned by their very structure to the howling of wolves and the honking of geese. to shut ourselves off from these other sensibilities to the oblivion of extinction, is to rob our own senses of their integrity, and to rob our minds of their coherence. we are human only in contact, and conviviality, with what is not human.\" - david abram, spell of the

working to make my other childhood dream come true  becoming an architect. fortunately again, this dream came true (for the most part) years ago after several years of working towards it and it continues, as it most likely always will, today.  now, i live and work in san francisco  knocking out the san francisco thing. besides a couple of minor setbacks, mostly architectural, i love this
