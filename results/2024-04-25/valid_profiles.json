scubaing -- i need to learn to swim more efficiently...  things i don't do that i'd like to start: cooking, badmintonning, tennissing, bass guitarring (i have a dusty bass), golfing, fishing/crabbing, various dancing (i'm amazingly uncoordinated), capoeira, & aerial circus. would also be nice to pilot a plane or to sail a boat or to sub a marine.  i'm nomy teleportation skills (currently non-existent... or at least very very slow and resembling walking).\nprocrastinating.  message me so we can distract one another.\nprobably my short attention span or that i\nbooks. my favorite author is tom robbins. i also like the little prince, mistborn trilogy, hunger games, ender's game, freakanomics, and i have a bad habit of not finishing books i start. i can't keep up with my own rss, wikipedia is awesome. also, since i like it and don't know where else to mention it, i love ted talks and npr   movies & tv. the princess bride is my favorite movie. my favorite show is the west wing. my tiny dvd collection consists of a lot of joss whedon, amelie, baraka, and shaolin soccer. i like the daily show, dexter, how i met your mother, and stuff by brian fuller etc.   music. \"i wish i'd stayed asleep today\" \"sha la la la la la la la la la la tee da\" \"bitches love me cause they know that i can rock\" \"i wake up! and my mind's out, never again will i sell out. converting vegetarians.\" \"i've done the the math enough to know the dangers of a second guessing. doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication.\" \"we were born in a minefield, in a world that's spinning like a roulette wheel, where everybody is so scared but they can't slow down\" \"words to memorize, words hypnotize words make my mouth exercise\" \"i'm me, me be, goddamn, i am, i can, sing and, here me, know me.\" -- and since i can't actually type out lyrics for it, i love the string quartet and apocalyptica. yumness   foods. i love food, sometimes i forget to eat. i like meat, steak - medium rare. i like veggies - except eggplant. i like fruits - especially your mom. i dislike bland foods. i like spicy make-you-cry - not spicy make-me-cry. i like bread. i like pi. i like pie. i like pirates (maybe not to eat. unless they are covered in crispy bacon...)\n000. mobility. car + fastrak, feet, bike, public transportation. passport. what would happen if you farted wearing a jet pack?  001. my ability and desire to learn  010. sunblock, appropriate shoes, and advil.  011. excitability! eee!!  100. friends & family  101. monkeys, they have made my life very funny. seriously.  110. 1s and 0s.\ni get really obsessive about things. i'm inappropriately curious about things (or at least it seems.) sometimes it's short lived, other times it's not. i like new experiences. when someone says, \"eww!! omg this smells soooooo gross!! smell it!\" and proceeds to shove whatever it is into my face, my mental process goes along the lines of, \"does this person hate me? why do they want me to smell the yuk? i wonder what kind of yuk it smells like. i wonder how bad it is? i must know\" and proceed to sniff it and realize that yes, i have been nasally violated.  i used to think a lot about wow, but then i beat the game.\nlooking for something better to do\ni suck at video games but i make them.\n i want you to -- and you'll only know if i want you to if you do, so you should. or you are still awake. or you are playful with words, puppies, and life. or you have something better to do, in which case i want to know what is and if i can join in in the betterment. or you are interested in sharing your favorite whisky (or scotch!) with me. or you can think of a better reason to message me. yea, then do that one. --- .-. / -.-- --- ..- / - --- ---

times. i'm good at being ordinary, at least in the old-fashioned sense. i'm realizing more and more that i belong to the 40s and 50s era, at least as far as values. i'm good at math. i'm good at writing essays and arguments and so on and so forth. i can write poems from the technical standpoint and suck with the wording, or i can write a poem full of beautiful words with no structure. i seem incapable of both simultaneously. i can read sentences upside-down (i come to find a lot of people can't, which surprises me). i have double-jointed elbows, so i can make my arm look broken if i do it right. at the very least, i can weird someone out by doing it, though it feels really nice, like a good stretch. i'm good at spelling....usually. apparently, this skill takes maintenance, something i haven't properly kept up. hence, i forget how to spell words like difficult or separate from time to time.\nmy eye....long story, but i can only see out of one of them. outside of that, alot of people think i'm funny or goofy.\nbooks: star wars, novelizations on action/comic movies (batman, day after tomorrow, etc.), books by nicolas sparks, so on and so forth. movies: star wars, lord of the rings, war movies (independence day, the core, etc), romantic comedies, disney movies. music: alternative, rock, 70's rock, beatles, beach boys, some metal, mainstream food: i'm open to try almost anything. i don't do freaky things like brains or cow foot, and i already know i don't like pineapple or mushrooms. other than that, i'm one of the most experimental people i know. i even tried african food at one point, which was awesome. for those curious few, it's rather similar to indian curry (the dish i tried at least).\n1. computer 2. books 3. people 4. cell phone 5. humor 6. ....food and water? lol\nmoving, both physically somewhere else (i'm thinking of wyoming) and mentally/professionally onto bigger and better things.  i also wonder about animals and their thoughts, and i think on how many other people are thinking the same things.\ngaming or watching a movie after shabbat services (converting to judaism). i work all week on a standard 9-5, so when i come home on fridays, i usually break out the heavy guns and start doing something interesting with my life again. gaming comes back into focus, books and movies are enjoyed, i occasionally will meet up with friends or coworkers to go out and do something interesting like a movie theater, or eating out at a diner somewhere.\ni'm addicted to people. and not in a hannibal lecter sort of way, but more like in a \"i thrive on human interaction, and without other human beings to help keep me sane, i'd probably become a raving mad person staggering down the gutter streets of market st, sf\" kind of way.\nif you like what you see, talk to me. i've seen some pretty funny answers thrown into these boxes, but i'm getting back to the core of the question. if you want to talk to me, then talk to me. it's as simple as that - i'm weary of the games involved in online communities, and i just want to take scissors to the red tape that's clogged up the works.\n", "essays_len": 5564}, {"age": "yes", "status": "single", "sex": "m",

most of the authors are narcissistic and lack an edit button. no one can honestly tell me that outliers needed to be that long.  movies: don't tell mom the babysitters dead, an american in paris, clueless, daddy long legs, the red shoes, midnight in paris, requiem for a dream, miracle on 34th street, pi, wayne's world, anything from pixar, alladin, and big fish.\nmy phone and piano are the only non-negotiables\ni'm a very curious person. i spend a lot of time googling things with a life-long goal of becoming a snapple cap. success and self-improvement also occupy large chunks of my thoughts. whether it is finding ways to generate more creative, fulfilling work or developing the skills needed to become a better composer, it's usually on my mind. i also think of ways to live in other places, not that i don't love sf, but i have a desire to live other places. i'm interested in living in london, new york, and really anywhere completely different; granted, it must be relatively safe.\n\ni can't tell a story without mimicking the people's voices and accents that i'm talking about. people either love it or hate it, but i don't realize i'm doing it.\nyou are over 6'0ft tall;

with this info, but apparently it wasn't saved correctly. apologies to all i haven't personally answered since early march. good luck to all! ****  born and bred in and around nyc (got a problem with that?). married, divorced and moved out to the west coast in the late 80s after months of traveling to australia, new zealand and hawaii.  left a high powered position with ny state parks and rec and reinvented myself as a independent consultant managing small businesses and planning events.  was very involved for many years with the contra dance community in ny and here in california, attending dances, weekend festivals and even running a week-long camp in the sierra for 8 years. still dance, though not as much as i'd like. also enjoy swing dancing, cajun and zydeco, and rocking out to any good live band. attend hardly strictly bluegrass festival every year and even in my \"advanced\" years can negotiate the huge crowds and manage to have a blast.  some other things about me in no particular order: love to try new things - learning the ukulele now, was in an improv troupe in sf for several years. i'm a tree hugger, a peace marcher, petition signer, dog lover, museum goer, puzzle solver, hiker, dancer, explorer, yoga practicer, game player (the milton bradley kind), care giver, great listener, playful, honest, sincere, irreverent but never irrelevant. enjoy witty repartee and clever word play.\n\nparallel parking. really.\n\nbooks - a few that come to mind: the piano tuner, life of pi, devil in the white city, the plot against america, most anything by ann patchett especially bel canto, most anything by marge piercy, michael chabon, tom robbins, and on and on.  movies - romantic comedies from the 40's. anything frank capra, woody allen, film noir and dark foreign films. and if hollywood remakes a classic foreign film - give me the original any day. the dutch original of the vanishing is a great example - hauntingly disturbing and thought-provoking.  music is important. my eclectic tastes run from gershwin to grateful dead to bluegrass to jazz standards to classic rock to show tunes. ask me to sing commercial jingles from the

and out of all these experiences i take the best of all of it and apply (or at least try ;-d ) to my life.  i have a soft spot for sweet and sensitive ladies, i cherish independent and strong women, and i have nothing but love for witty humor and charm. and while all these things will earn you absurd amounts of bonus points, all of it really comes down to is two people having a great time together. i'm looking for a great friend, a companion, and a lover (not necessarily in that order). everything else is icing on the cake, although a good sense of sarcastic humor may be a prerequisite.  a few additional quirks you'll probably want to know include: - i have a mildly embarrassing addiction to reality tv shows like what not to wear, fear factor, and real housewives of (city x).  - i'm also easily baited into conversations about philosophy, psychology, and physics, although i promise not to bore you unless you've been very very naughty.  - at times i've been known
