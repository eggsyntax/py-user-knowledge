 a bit about me:  i prefer deep to superficial. i like the idea of \"living more simply so that others my simply live\". i'm able to laugh at myself. i dig board games and really enjoy playing scrabble (my 13-year-old still beats me at chess...i'm going to have to practice way more!). i enjoy being physically active (running, yoga, hiking), and i also enjoy just kicking it on the deck with a good book. some of my newest interests are vermiposting and cultivating a plot in the community garden. i'd like to get more into mountain biking. i'm more drawn to nature than i am to the city, although i'd love to be taken on a city adventure that would blow my mind and challenge me to second guess that statement!  i enjoy movies...mostly those that have a positive message...and comedies! i don't meditate in the conventional manner, but am very contemplative and reflective. i drink, yet only very occasionally...either socially, or a glass of wine with dinner. i enjoy supporting local merchants and farmers who put effort into creating their goods in way that is sustainable. i'm mostly an omnivore, but have also been known to go raw for months at a time. some mornings i am into coffee, other mornings it might be juiced beets and greens. i'm a fan of variation and moderation :0)\nbeginning to branch out! now that i am beginning to feel a little more settled into my new career, i am ready to re-direct some of that energy into socializing and enriching my life on other levels.  looking forward to expanding my circle of friends, getting back into running regularly, and nosome long-term financial goals. would also like to encorporate more camping, hot springs, road trips, live shows, and creative energy into my life...thinking about signing up for an art class at college of marin as i'd like to learn more about japanese woodblock printing (check out http://www.tomkillion.com/). just started learning to knit and am almost done with my first hat (who knew knitting could be sooo addicting?).\nconnecting with people of all ages ages and backgrounds, making lemonade out of lemons, cartwheels, being punctual, kicking it, making salads, organizing, wrapping gifts, being silly...\nit depends on the person, of course! how about... eye contact and a reciprocating smile?!?!\nbooks: the omnivore's dilemma  movies: shawshank redemption. my newest fav: http://www.thefirstgrader-themovie.com/  shows: anything live and intimate  music: dead, dylan, todd snider, marley, cake, phish, alison krauss, ben harper, david grisman, stones, james brown, van morrison.....  food: fresh, seasonal, organic, locally grown food - yum!\nmaslow's hierarchy...\nways to live more simply...how to be more balanced...moderation...how grateful i am to have my health...taking an art class..do i still have enough time to train for the dipsea this year?...learning how to play the guitar...sup...buying a used kayak... traveling...\ndepends...having a potluck, hosting a sleepover for my 13-year-old, camping...could be at a live show dancing, or giving bikrim yoga another go, moon bathing, hanging on bolinas ridge watching the sun set, cuddled up on the couch with my daughter watching a movie...making kale chips in the dehydrater...journaling...sharing laughs with friends...\ni wear size 9.5 shoes...sometimes 10, depending on the brand.\nyou're a kind, caring soul who loves to laugh, you're open-minded, and a total lover of life...if you are a good communicator... if the idea of hiking in the moonlight puts a smile on your face...if you dig live music...if you are comfortable in your own skin...\n", "essays_len": 4203}

interesting to them, and that they enjoy sharing. i am an exceptionally good listener, and i enjoy trying to figure things out both for and with others. watching tv makes me very sad unless it's something on pbs.\ni take this as a complex existential question, and it is not going to be answered in a paragraph, but....trying my best would be the simple answer.  i spend a fair amount of time trying to figure out what we are doing here, where we are going and how i might spend the time here more wisely. i hope this is not all there is, but since it just might be, i try to enjoy it as much as possible. i am a bit of an epicurean, and gravitate toward pleasure/comfort, but appreciate the character-developing aspect of exploring uncomfortable territory.\ncooking. analyzing. appreciating. communicating.\nmy beard. my eyes. that i am not afraid to say what i think.\ni don't read a lot of books and when i do they tend to be non-fiction, philosophy or some kind of research for a project. i like movies but i have little time to go them, and not into mainstream films or pop culture. i like art films.  music taste is mostly classical, opera, concert music. love nina simone, joni mitchell, leonard cohen, etc. movies i like are rashomon, bitter tears of petra von kant, menilmontant, notte di cabiria, santa sangre, that kind of stuff. composers: bach, janacek, britten, mahler, martinu, and sometimes most of all: schubert.\nthis seems like a question that would inspire the universe to deprive me of whatever i write down. but...the things i like a lot are green tea, classical music, museums, german theater and cooking a fine meal. yeah, i know that wasn't six things, but i hate following directions.\nthe state of the world. sex.\ndoing nothing different than any other night.\nask me.\nyou're curious, intelligent, energetic and spend some amount of your time wondering and wandering. you want to be in some kind of communicative relationship with another guy.\n",
