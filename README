Series of experiments testing how well LLMs (mainly GPT-3.5) can predict 
demographics from text (mainly OKCupid profiles).

This is HORRIBLE CODE. This was my experiment with letting GPT-4 generate 
most of the individual functions, and then it's just patches on patches 
from there.

It suffers further from my initial naivete about typical ML conventions for 
eg data representation, so I'm munging data back and forth in a bunch of places.

Ideally I will rewrite it when I get time, but also when do I ever get time?

Caveat emptor.
