born in texas, grew up in georgia, went to college in new york, and have now moved to california. i'm not sure what that pattern says about me except that it seems like i'm about to lap the country. i think i'm either going to be a genre fiction writer or a lawyer and that pairing makes total sense in my head. i don't smoke and i don't drink coffee but i secretly suspect people who do both are cooler than i am. i tend to make random lists in the hopes that some theme will emerge from them but sometimes they don't.\ni've moved out to san francisco from new york to get a graduate degree in the arts and the internet, so about half my time is spent getting the degree and the other half is spent wondering what the hell i'm going to do with it once i've got it.\nadventures. good adventuring takes planning mixed with a sense of whimsy, like parties, which i'm also pretty good at throwing. i also tend to give really good media recommendations so feel free to come to me if you are looking for new music/books/tv/movies.  also a friend is insistent that i say that i am a good, active listener but i think that is getting dangerously into \"i enjoy long walks on the beach\" territory so i am splitting the difference by explaining that i was forced into it.\ni'm pretty tall and usually surprisingly well dressed for san francisco.\ni'm not sure how to narrow this down so we're just going with the cultural products i'm really into right now.  books: i'm currently reading perdido street station by chine mieville for my fiction book and a biography of dorothy parker for my non-fiction.  movies: the last two movies i saw were inception and scott pilgrim and i think both of them are going to be remembered as important parts of film history for very different reasons.  music: the last
