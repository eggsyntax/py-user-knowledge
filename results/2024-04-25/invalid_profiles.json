plan to work in investment banking, private equity, or venture capital, before going on to an mba program after 2-3 years and then returning to pe/vc. i'm not really quite sure where i want to live yet, but it must be full of bright people and incredible landscape and/or city views.  update: i've joined deloitte consulting in san francisco after completing my service with teach for america. i know basically no one out here so i'd love to make some new friends in the bay area.\n-writing -painting (oil), though it's been a while -statistical analysis -shopping -photography\n-very blue eyes

not involved in, seeing the good in people, playing my guitar, showing my son how to have fun and be a decent man.\nidk. i'm not privy to their point of view.  outstanding personality, and eyes! ~ felini\nbooks: read a bunch like a bunch don't feel like naming them all ...  movies: on any sunday, does anybody even know what this movie is. extra brownie points if you do. the princess bride is hands down the best movie ever. but i can enjoy any good movie be it, documentary's, sci fi, rom com, or blow everything up to keep you hooked action.  tv shows: discovery science is the best channel ever, second only to the speed channel. oh how i love watching the racing.  music: metal and other stuff like classical, which i to listen to every night as i'm going to bed. or children of bodom, metallica, nevermore. rammstien, machine head, iced earth, your mama, mommies friend, afi, black label society. ozzy, black sabbath, ronnie james dio, iron maiden, joe satriani, yngwie malmsteen, eric johnson, pantera, system of a down, jose feliciano,the trans-siberian orchestra, the electric light orchestra, resin, nine inch nails, fubar, the red hot chile peppers.....\nwell the first three spots are taken up by my son, and then it would be, air, water and my dirt bike.\neverything. from the state of affairs surrounding me, to playing my guitar, to how hard is it to replace the timing belt on a 2002 camry, to whether or not i should jump on my son's dirt bike just to blast down the street to feel the wind in my hair.\ngoing to bed, cuz i work saturday's :(\nanything and everything. i will not lie to you, just ask and i will freely admit it if i did it. conversely, i expect the same.\nif you wanna talk, hangout, comment on the utter ridiculousness that is my self-summary, anything

a career, rather than just a job, i have a great 18 year old punk rocker for a son, and i feel that i have attained most of the goals i set for myself, yet i am still jazzed about what i do, after 30 years with the same company, and becoming ceo/president in 1998. i just find business and working with people to be a real kick. if i can get paid for it, too - well, that's just icing on the cake!  my personality is perceived as laid back, but i am very driven, otherwise i wouldn't be where i am today. i somehow distrust when people say how honest or humble they are in their profiles. over the years, i have learned that not everyone is honest, so some of the ones that say they are honest, must be lying about it. also, the most humble people i know, would never claim that they were... what would the dalai lama say?  my ideal match is a humorous, straight forward, open minded woman of average, athletic, fit, slim/slender or petite build. not obsessed with working out, but takes care of herself physically. politically liberal, but not part of the occupy movement. if her idea of camping is a hotel without room service, we'll get along just fine. she also probably isn't gay, hung up on her father or ex, or a church lady. she might believe in the power of crystals, but also knows that they are just rocks. rough edges are encouraged to apply.  i still hold out the hope of meeting someone who i can't imagine spending the rest of my life without. best friends and lovers and partners in life. physical chemistry is a must - i want to be with someone that makes me dizzy when i kiss her. i left a 21 year marriage because i would rather be alone, than with someone who just wanted me as an accessory to her life. i don't think holding hands or kissing in public is exclusively behavior for newlyweds. i believe in having a big love, and i'm willing to roll the dice!  please, don't contact me if you live in another time zone or don't have a photo.\nhaving a good time, so

dance if the setting is right (even though i'm not that good at it), i like to make time for anything social, even just sharing anecdotes over making dinner or drinks with someone. i am an explorer, i make en effort to break from the routine and try something or go somewhere new. i'm pretty sincere about my ideas and feelings, i have a deep sense of empathy for others, i try to make the world a better place, really. i am ambitious, but i usually bite off more than i can chew.  i am intelligent, thoughtful, and random.\ni am currently working full time at a non-profit. my real passion though, is writing and understanding new advances in different fields, be it cosmology or economics. eventually, i would like to get a job as a journal writer or researcher.\nsurprisingly, i am pretty good at cooking. i've been complimented several times about the style in which i choose to cook. i am quick to grasp complex things in the first try and i am able to see how things work. also, i'm pretty good at telling jokes.\nwell besides my physical appearance, it would probably be my demeanor. i've almost always come across to someone new as humble, empathic and, depending on the conversation, as someone well read.\nbooks: brave new world, 1984, reason in revolt, the ethics, choke, don quixote, the interrupted revolution, starship troopers, the gods themselves, the shape of things to come, war & peace, the grapes of wrath, the jungle, tao te ching, the dialectics of nature, the big bang never happened, pihkal.  film: i really enjoy educational documentaries. i am cuba, solaris, dr. strangelove, amores perros, tu mama tambien and anything with martin lawrance.  music: classical (specially shostakovich), punk, hardcore, gabber, jumpstyle, trance, psytrance, house, classic rock, ska, dance hall, ragga, cumbia, ambient, some industrial/ebm, anything good really  food: i like to eat practically anything.\nhealth, friendship, fun, learning, music, optimism\nto understand and improve the world we live in so that one day all people are able to enjoy its beauty to the fullest.\nusually having a drink with friends, if not probably reading or noan article.\ni really dread dating rituals.\nif anything i wrote sounds interesting and you think we might get along.\n", "essays_len": 2879}, {"age": "no", "status": "single", "sex": "m", "orientation": "gay", "education":

(dont ask unless you really want to know.)  i work out as much as i can when possible these days and like to have fun while doing it. but i gotta stay in shape or at least healthy to go on all these trips and eat all these amazing types of foods!  i think i mentioned this before but....i love to travel!!!! i have family in hk (hong kong) and australia so i have been to both places as well as japan and canada. a few other places i will visit within the following year(s) will be europe, thailand, germany and if all goes well maybe indonesia. i'd love to one day go to africa, dubai, & egypt. hey who knows the world is my pearl because i've already found the oyster. the only thing missing now is a traveling companion......aaaannndddd maybe some spending cash.\ni am a jack of all trades so you'll have to hang out with me and find out what i am good at  i am also pretty good at video and board games like from cranium to anything, pictionary, guestures, apples to apples you name it!\nmy smile i've always smiled growing up even my family told me when i was a baby i was always smiling. plus the fact that i only have one dimple.... and then they notice my intuitive side and my ability to read people and understand women.\nmy favorite book.....i dunno everyones bio that i've read always says \"catcher in the rye\" and i really liked that book but everyone seems to like it but there are others like \"one flew over the coocoo's nest\" for example. but there are others  i'll watch any movie and enjoy it. but my favorite movies are listed. not in any particular order. 1. idiocracy 2. any disney/pixar film (kind of a disney fan) but a huge favorite is toy story 3. forgetting sarah marshall 4. inception 5. bridesmaids 6. he's not that into you 7. the notebook 8. role models 9. transformers 10. shawshank redemption 11. forrest gump 12. romeo must die 13. dark knight and so on and so on (i'm a movie buff btw)  ok t.v. shows..... here we go! practically anything on the food network: challenge the great food truck race best thing i ever ate chopped cupcake wars etc...etc...  hardcore pawn for the outrageous drama that happens in detroit. law & order svu csi ncis monday night raw the sing off the voice criminal minds big bang theory how i met your mother arrested development and a lot more i dvr everything! i'll watch anything =p  foods: i'll try anything once. i love food and it amazes me what new feats have been made in the food industry where i feel everything should be tried at least once in your life. (maybe not so much when it comes to bugs....but who knows) i like to explore new places to eat as well you never know what that hole in the wall may have in-store for you! but i'm not so lazy as to never cook at home since i have the skills to do so. i love to cook since its a pass time/passion of mine. i would also love to cook for my loved ones, so a few nights out of the year i cook for my family so they enjoy what i make.\n1. family esp. my sister and mother (this includes my puppies since they are family) 2. friends 3. my android phone (no iphone/crackberry here!) =p 4. my laptop 5. caffeine!!!! 6. i dunno.... you!!!(hey if all goes well it might just be right?)\neverything.... my mind is in constant motion. i am very analytical so therefor i really do ponder on many different things in life. its really just a matter of who wants to know what goes on in my mind and who i am willing to share those thoughts with. i also believe that there is a big difference in hearing someone and listening to someone. and i have a theory when it comes to dumb and stupid. if you want to know just ask. i'll be glad to share my ideas.  i am up for any type of conversation and listen to any opinion anyone has, even if we dont see eye to eye its how you feel that's how life works no one agrees with everything or everyone, you have a mind and so do i. i'd love to share my thoughts with someone who doesnt mind listening but in return for that i will appreciate it and will return the favor since you took the time to listen and respect my thoughts i will do the same. that and whether or not you'll actually message me back.\nit differs on my mood. it varies from hanging out at a friends house to just staying in and catching a movie on netflix. theater movies, broadway shows, or even maybe some cuddle time and some alone time with that special someone. clubbing happens but i try to minimize that to special gatherings. but i do enjoy dancing!\ni tried out for \"american idol\" and want to try out for \"the voice\".  but if you really want to know all you have to do is ask. ;p\nyou are interested in a friendship or more. people who like to have fun message me. i have never been conventional so when you think that all this you read about is it.... you've only seen the bottom and to find out more about this mountain all you gotta do is climb to find out.\n", "essays_len": 7982}, {"age": "yes", "status": "seeing someone", "sex": "m", "orientation": "straight", "education": "", "ethnicity": "white", "income": "-1", "job": "computer / hardware /

waiting for guffman, the goonies, the princess bride, the thin man series, stand by me, running on empty, house of yes, the long kiss goodnight, clue, the hangover, multiplicity, heathers, love

people who doesn't own a tv.) arrested development, buffy the vampire slayer, doctor horrible, firefly, flight of the conchords.  music: eclectic. two of my favorite albums are movie soundtracks: reservoir dogs, 1969 (favorite soundtracks, *not* favorite movies).  but let's be honest, most of the time i am listening to npr. \"this american life\" = yummy!  food: if i could live on appetizers

homes in oxford ms and crescent city ca.  i've done the internet dating thing for a good while now. truth is, the only way to see what chemistries exist in real life is to meet in real life. no matter how good we look to each other on paper, it has little bearing on how much we will enjoy each other's company, or our pheromonal attraction, or any of the myriad minutiae that make us value the presence of another enough to want them in our lives. i'm sensitive to and value qualities like grace in voice, grace in movement (you can be a klutz and still be graceful ;). you can only discover those things by actually being with a person.  that said...here's a few things i think are important in knowing who i am.  i'm an outsider (despite my normal appearance), and find i fit best with other outsiders (with relatively normal appearances). by outsider, i mean non-mainstream, people who see outside the dominant american paradigm. i am an outsider through my intellect and my creativity, but one can be an outsider by any means that gives the perspective of being an outside observer, such as being from another culture (either foreign, or a subculture of our own country). i once dated a gal who was fully half-japanese and half-caucasian, but looked all white. she grew up in the south and, because of her \"normal\" appearance, heard all kinds of despicable racist crap said in her presence, under the assumption she was a good ol' white girl, \"one of their own kind.\" while we had differences in world view (polar opposites on religion), i believe her outsider experience gave us a common ground for mutual appreciation that was part of our attraction (she was also a warm sweetie, totally hot, and the most yummy kisser i've ever had the pleasure to brush lips with).  i'm an intellectual with a boundless curiosity. i love playing with ideas, learning something new, juxtaposing things in new ways, seeking patterns. i'm a holistic thinker (for one example, seeing that the mainstream american paradigm is only one small part of what actually exists, or is possible). i'm a logical thinker and a skeptic, which is also why i'm an atheist (there is no credible evidence that gods created humankind, but it is extremely credible that humankind created gods [and all the accompanying religious mumbo-jumbo baggage]).  i'm creative to my bones, both as an artist (background in theater, dance, and music) and in anything i do. i couldn't do a job for long if there was not some element of creativity possible.  though intellectual, i am also very much in my body. i've been a professional dancer, have always been a competent athlete (currently in love with soccer), and am highly sensual and sexual.  i've come to learn that the concept of flow is the dominant theme of who i am and what i value. flow is essentially \"effortless experience,\" as when athletes talk about being \"in the zone.\" it is when \"all the lights turn red to green,\" when you talk for hours and it seems like minutes, creating improvisational music that feels like it's telling you what to play and you are just along for a fun ride, combining a series of passes to thread through a soccer defense, or sex where you seem to become one with the other, effortlessly. i seek experiences of flow, and i facilitate others having such experience. flow is not just about art and sport, it's a practical everyday concept, such as waiting on a corner to let ten cars pass instead of making them all stop and idle, burning gas, so one (ignorant/selfish/arrogant berkeley) pedestrian can stroll across the street. or creating a website where the user can easily find what they want instead of grinding their teeth in frustration.  flow is why i love soccer, capoeira, tap dance and music improv, and parkour.  if the above appears rather dry, i should say i am also low-drama, warm, kind, outgoing, and have a sense of humor, from silly to subtle. i've never felt the need to say \"liars need not apply\" because i simply don't have such people in my life.  and i'm waaaaaay left politically (at least when speaking about my own country). i think our american economic system is inherently immoral. i have almost as little respect for most democratic politicians as i do for republican ones, and couldn't bring myself to vote for obama, yet again the lesser evil of the demoblican center-right candidates. until we entirely change direction, the poor in this country will always be working their butts off for table scraps. that said, i do value the day-to-day kindnesses of average people, no matter their political or religious persuasions.  on the other hand, i can't stand p.c. bull. if you find my screename offensive, we're not meant to be. if you find it amusing, we're off to a good start. ;)", "essay1": "i spent the earlier part of my life doing \"day gigs\" to support my artistic pursuits, including a fair amount of geek jobs. a few years ago, i decided to get full-time work in the nonprofit sector (i avoid the corporate world as much as humanly possible). i spent two years at one org before moving on, and had been trying to break into nonprofit communications (unsuccessfully) before accepting my current position. i feel communications is where i have the most to offer (again, related to flow).  i currently manage and develop a for-profit green waste recycling facility, complete with sawmill. it's not my \"life's work,\" but it's worthy of my efforts and has a lot to teach me. it's informative for a desk jockey like me to have to work closely with the kind of down and dirty tasks necessary to maintain the urban infrastructure we all take for granted. it adds to that holistic vision i was talking about before.  i still work pro bono on the nonprofit side, for an arts/literacy organization that teaches at-risk kids in public elementary schools. i help with their donor and grant development. when i move on from my current position, i expect it will be back to the nonprofit side in development and communications.  it's been awhile since my last band, but now that i've got my job situation managed, i'm looking to start something new in the near future.", "essay2": "a lot. no point in false modesty. people who know me for my expertise in one area are sometimes startled to find out months later about my expertise in another. i'm fortunate to have a huge capacity to learn, which i enjoy, so i tend to get good at anything i try. i started soccer at 42 (after starting capoeira at 40. while just an average decent player, no one would guess today that i only started playing 8 years ago.  if the above sounds at all self-congratulatory, i truly enjoy and encourage the talents of others.", "essay3": "warm eyes. humor. liveliness. my 'masculine\" baritone. that i'm tap dancing in the supermarket aisle. some gals think i'm incredibly handsome, others i'm sure i don't even blip on their radar. sexy lips. i often get that i'm very easy to be with and talk to.", "essay4": "generally speaking in art, i like complex simplicity, and asymmetric balance (ah, fred astaire, the master). i don't like things neat and predictable, but i also don't like artifice or complexity for its own sake. i have plenty of guilty musical pleasures, since i adore a well-constructed pop tune (even a sappy one). my music origins are american folk/pop/rock. my last band was all-original world beat upbeat dance music: soca, soukous, funk, salsa, samba, etc.  i appreciate sheer beauty of sound. currently, that means listening to the exquisite voice of marcela gandara singing dame tus ojos (you can find her live duet with jesus adrian romero on youtube). i discovered it when a coworker programmed it as a ringtone on his cell. it's mexican christian music. me, i hear a love song. if you were to ask me where i'd want to travel to most, i'd say it'd be to sit in a living room anywhere playing music intimately with someone of marcela's caliber...that's the kind of journey i enjoy most.  my favorite pop song of the moment: 1901 by the french-band-that-sings-in-english phoenix (check out this performance on letterman. i love their non-pretentious presentation; the energy is in the music itself, not the force-fed phony \"deep\" emotion slathered-on in buckets that is typical of most \"artists.\"  this past year, been diggin' on alison krauss and her awesome musicians. and am a late discoverer of whiskeytown/ryan adams. what a great sounding band. i have a few tunes with a similar alt country/rock vibe. his songs are remarkably easy to learn, a tribute to their musical integrity. latest- just learned firecracker this past week (aug 2010).  for dancing, nothing beats old skool funk. can't stand rap...i don't consider someone yelling at me music, yo, y'all.  one of the true great singers of our time: zeca pagodinho, the king of samba pagode. simple, direct, effortless...just perfect.  i'm a dark chocolate (if it ain't chocolate, it's not dessert), coffee, red wine, dog, soft slow wet kiss person (not a vanilla, tea, white wine, cat, neat dry kiss person...nothing wrong with any of those- except the neat dry kisses....yiiich!! white wine is sorta ecch too.). being single in berkeley, i tend to eat out at little mom & pop ethnic places a lot. current favorite: de afghanan kabob house in berkeley, down near the international corner (university ave at san pablo ave). if you love simply prepared grilled meat, it can't be beat (vegetarians also seem to be happy with the menu). and nazir (a.k.a.\"john\") is a great host, sometimes helped by his lovely daughters.  i've read a ton, but now i tend to only read nonfiction. don't really feel the need to pick up a book often, usually find hours of interesting stuff on any topic on the internet. but here's a few influential and favorite books:  (if you liked the davinci code, we have *totally* incompatible senses of aesthetics. man, i like good pulp (i.e. men in black), but that was a stinking turd, truly stunningly awful plodding writing, painful to read.)  recent reads:  tipping point, blink, by malcom gladwell, both excellent  the design of everyday things, by donald a. norman  thought dreams by michael albert. great book on constructing a new progressive political theory, avoiding the pitfalls of marxism, feminism, anarchism, and the various nationalisms.  old favorites:  the cocktail party, by t.s. elliot  alice in wonderland books  the clown, by henrich bll  ridley walker, by russell hoban  shakespeare's plays  the pursuit of loneliness, by philip slater  the drama of the gifted child, by alice miller  movies: i like good pulp (men in black), character-driven comedy (my cousin vinny), as well as more esoteric stuff (breaking the waves, fitzcarraldo, memento, fight club). i enjoy tv, including reality shows (the apprentice...that anyone actually *wants* to work for the donald is already the makings of comedy), lie to me, glee, the office, and reruns of shows i never watched when they aired (scrubs, everybody loves raymond, bernie mac).", "essay5": "ah jeez, dunno...i really love down comforters (and the cool weather to accomodate them...hence my living in the bay area). not much, really. i enjoy my body and my brain...if either were seriously impacted, i don't know if that's a quality of life i'd consider worth living.", "essay6": "whatever problem/puzzle i'm trying to solve, or some creative project...whether at work, at play or changing the world. i

you think we might be simpatico. your agenda is the same as mine: you want to see if/how we click, then go from there.  i hit it off best with vibrant women who are highly intelligent, politically progressive, direct, flirty, warm, unaffected, affectionate, independent and low drama. east coasters, chicagoans, nuyoricans and recovering catholics welcome. :) internationals too (brits, aussies, canucks, kiwis, et al). closeminded need not apply; the people i enjoy hanging with are not phobic about race, ethnicity, or sexuality, aren't fans of evil bush and co, nor are they rigidly pc. maybe you have passionate interests, or exceptional creative or intellectual talent. i have a strong, unique vision, it'd be great to be with someone who could appreciate that & perhaps have her own.  to

kindnesses of average people, no matter their political or religious persuasions.  on the other hand, i can't stand p.c. bull. if you find my screename offensive, we're not meant to be. if you find it amusing, we're off to a good start. ;)\ni spent the earlier part of my life doing \"day gigs\" to support my artistic pursuits, including a fair amount of geek jobs. a few years ago, i decided to get full-time work in the nonprofit sector (i avoid the corporate world as much as humanly possible). i spent two years at one org before moving on, and had been trying to break into nonprofit communications (unsuccessfully) before accepting my current position. i feel communications is where i have the most to offer (again, related to flow).  i currently manage and develop a for-profit green waste recycling facility, complete with sawmill. it's not my \"life's work,\" but it's worthy of my efforts and has a lot to teach me. it's informative for a desk jockey like me to have to work closely with the kind of down and dirty tasks necessary to maintain the urban infrastructure we all take for granted. it adds to that holistic vision i was talking about before.  i still work pro bono on the nonprofit side, for an arts/literacy organization that teaches at-risk kids in public elementary schools. i help with their donor and grant development. when i move on from my current position, i expect it will be back to the nonprofit side in development and communications.  it's been awhile since my last band, but now that i've got my job situation managed, i'm looking to start something new in the near future.\na lot. no point in false modesty. people who know me for my expertise in one area are sometimes startled to find out months later about my expertise in another. i'm fortunate to have a huge capacity to learn, which i enjoy, so i tend to get good at anything i try. i started soccer at 42 (after starting capoeira at 40. while just an average decent player, no one would guess today that i only started playing 8 years ago.  if the above sounds at all self-congratulatory, i truly enjoy and encourage the talents of others.\nwarm eyes. humor. liveliness. my 'masculine\" baritone. that i'm tap dancing in the supermarket aisle. some gals think i'm incredibly handsome, others i'm sure i don't even blip on their radar. sexy lips. i often get that i'm very easy to be with and talk to.\ngenerally speaking in art, i like complex simplicity, and asymmetric balance (ah, fred astaire, the master). i don't like things neat and predictable, but i also don't like artifice or complexity for its own sake. i have plenty of guilty musical pleasures, since i adore a well-constructed pop tune (even a sappy one). my music origins are american folk/pop/rock. my last band was all-original world beat upbeat dance music: soca, soukous, funk, salsa, samba, etc.  i appreciate sheer beauty of sound. currently, that means listening to the exquisite voice of marcela gandara singing dame tus ojos (you can find her live duet with jesus adrian romero on youtube). i discovered it when a coworker programmed it as a ringtone on his cell. it's mexican christian music. me, i hear a love song. if you were to ask me where i'd want to travel to most, i'd say it'd be to sit in a living room anywhere playing music intimately with someone of marcela's caliber...that's the kind of journey i enjoy most.  my favorite pop song of the moment: 1901 by the french-band-that-sings-in-english phoenix (check out this performance on letterman. i love their non-pretentious presentation; the energy is in the music itself, not the force-fed phony \"deep\" emotion slathered-on in buckets that is typical of most \"artists.\"  this past year, been diggin' on alison krauss and her awesome musicians. and am a late discoverer of whiskeytown/ryan adams. what a great sounding band. i have a few tunes with a similar alt country/rock vibe. his songs are remarkably easy to learn, a tribute to their musical integrity. latest- just learned firecracker this past week (aug 2010).  for dancing, nothing beats old skool funk. can't stand rap...i don't consider someone yelling at me music, yo, y'all.  one of the true great singers of our time: zeca pagodinho, the king of samba pagode. simple, direct, effortless...just perfect.  i'm a dark chocolate (if it ain't chocolate, it's not dessert), coffee, red wine, dog, soft slow wet kiss person (not a vanilla, tea, white wine, cat, neat dry kiss person...nothing wrong with any of those- except the neat dry kisses....yiiich!! white wine is sorta ecch too.). being single in berkeley, i tend to eat out at little mom & pop ethnic places a lot. current favorite: de afghanan kabob house in berkeley, down near the international corner (university ave at san pablo ave). if you love simply prepared grilled meat, it can't be beat (vegetarians also seem to be happy with the menu). and nazir (a.k.a.\"john\") is a great host, sometimes helped by his lovely daughters.  i've read a ton, but now i tend to only read nonfiction. don't really feel the need to pick up a book often, usually find hours of interesting stuff on any topic on the internet. but here's a few influential and favorite books:  (if you liked the davinci code, we have *totally* incompatible senses of aesthetics. man, i like good pulp (i.e. men in black), but that was a stinking turd, truly stunningly awful plodding writing, painful to read.)  recent reads:  tipping point, blink, by malcom gladwell, both excellent  the design of everyday things, by donald a. norman  thought dreams by michael albert. great book on constructing a new progressive political theory, avoiding the pitfalls of marxism, feminism, anarchism, and the various nationalisms.  old favorites:  the cocktail party, by t.s. elliot  alice in wonderland books  the clown, by henrich bll  ridley walker, by russell hoban  shakespeare's plays  the pursuit of loneliness, by philip slater  the drama of the gifted child, by alice miller  movies: i like good pulp (men in black), character-driven comedy (my cousin vinny), as well as more esoteric stuff (breaking the waves, fitzcarraldo, memento, fight club). i enjoy tv, including reality shows (the apprentice...that anyone actually *wants* to work for the donald is already the makings of comedy), lie to me, glee, the office, and reruns of shows i never watched when they aired (scrubs, everybody loves raymond, bernie mac).\nah jeez, dunno...i really love down comforters (and the cool weather to accomodate them...hence my living in the bay area). not much, really. i enjoy my body and my brain...if either were seriously impacted, i don't know if that's a quality of life i'd consider worth living.\nwhatever problem/puzzle i'm trying to solve, or some creative project...whether at work, at play or changing the world. i think the obsessing phase of my life is over. i don't think life is all that complicated (complex, yes; complicated, no).\nat home. or on a date. i'm much more of a doer than a consumer (i.e. i'd much rather play music than go out to hear music, play sports than watch sports, do you than listen to you...i keeeed, i keeed ;).\ni had a mullet. for a good many years. cut it myself. badly. the good thing about it was i really didn't give a crap what people thought of how i looked. the bad thing about it was i really didn't give a crap what people thought of how i looked.  i wised up. i like grrls. i want they should like how i look.\nyou are a flirtatious outgoing playful woman (okc seems to think my ideal match is a bisexual woman in her 20s...that's alllllll good, but you can be straight or older too ;) . you are highly sensual and sexual. you are more curvy than androgynous (which doesn't mean unhealthily overweight). you find my pix attractive. you think we might be simpatico. your agenda is the same as mine: you want to see if/how we click, then go from there.  i hit it off best with vibrant women who are highly intelligent, politically progressive, direct, flirty, warm, unaffected, affectionate, independent and low drama. east coasters, chicagoans, nuyoricans and recovering catholics welcome. :) internationals too (brits, aussies, canucks, kiwis, et al). closeminded need not apply; the people i enjoy hanging with are not phobic about race, ethnicity, or sexuality, aren't fans of evil bush and co, nor are they rigidly pc. maybe you have passionate interests, or exceptional creative or intellectual talent. i have a strong, unique vision, it'd be great to be with someone who could appreciate that & perhaps have her own.  to get more of an idea of my sense of humor, have a gander at my long-in-the-tooth vanity website:

past-time, going to the beach is among my favorite activities of all time. just got back from miami and spent most of my time at the beach.  running around lake merritt or downtown walnut creek is my

that i have an open sense of humor, which can be quite sarcastic and over-the-top.  it's like friends, seinfield, family guy, and chuck norris combined.  e  ****if you a have a picture of yourself in

the same time, which sounds like a complete oxymoron. but if wine can be good for you and delicious, then in some things one can have their cake and eat it too. whether confident or humble, blessed is something that i definitely feel 24-7 and that's the most important aspect of life for me.  without the bless, what's left? i say!  i am an obsessive traveler and get \"high\" planning the next expedition (because planning is half of the fun). a wise man once said, \"for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also\" and my treasure at the moment is racking up the frequent flyet miles-- 40 countries before 40, and i am getting closer, but there is still plenty of ground to cover and having a travel companion is a definite plus!!  on a regular week i am at the gym, at the turkish coffee shop (philz in sf!), taking care of my family here and abroad, watching a movie, downtown sf or wc, cooking at home, figuring out my graduate aspirations.  music is a fundamental pillar in my life and will never stop \"listening\".  concerts are quite the treat, playing board games is a great past-time, going to the beach is among my favorite activities of all time. just got back from miami and spent most of my time at the beach.  running around lake merritt or downtown walnut creek is my wednesday thing.  i cook a lot and try to eat basic stuff--you know veggies, meats, cheeses, nuts, fruits... all that, but i do it so i can scarf me a whole arizmendi's pie on the weekend or eat ice cream at mitchell's in sf, or have a half dozen pupusas (extra points if you know what that is).  i like movies...a lot...especially the good ones. i did a telemundo commercial once and i am looking forward to doing something similar again..speaking of great films: biutiful was the last one i saw and it represents what most of my favorite movies are like.  i am a bit of a poet and have written half a book based loosely on my life, which someday will be published.  my favorite type out outing would have to start off at home or friend's house, we would acquire some nice liquor (i believe in good alcohol for some reason----it tastes better-delicious even!--no cuervo please!!!).... and i have such a great time making people drinks and sipping on drinks that i've made before heading out! then dance, dance and party all night. if you like salsa, bachata and merengue, we'll certainly have a great time.  i like doing stuff for people because it makes me feel like i am contributing back some of the bless in my life. cooking for people, mentoring math, and checking people's papers are other things that i strangely enjoy...  i consider myself to be trustworthy and honest and i demand that my match have this quality as well---this is non-negotiable. classy ladies deserve classy treatment and that's the only thing i know how to do (blame it on my mother).  i will warn you, however, that i have an open sense of humor, which can be quite sarcastic and over-the-top.  it's like friends, seinfield, family guy, and chuck norris combined.  e  ****if you a have a picture of yourself in the mirror with the middle finger to the air---i am good**** sorry, just can't do that....\ni have traveled a lot---i think its between 20-30 countries right now, i am nothe 40 by 40 situation....fortunately, i have a lot of time  work  work out  grad and professional school---ask me more....  party--gotta karaoke, drink and play board games  in that order...  and then there are acting, mixed martial arts, and yoga----hoping to expand on my passions

up with his family in vinh long province and stayed with his grandmother for about a year in the village. after he was around six years old, his family was given the opportunity to come to america because his father is a veteran of the vietnam war; he fought for south vietnam and, as a result, was forced to labor in various concentration camps for more than seven years after north vietnam, under communism rule, conquered the entire country. minh's family has been residing in san francisco, california since 1997; therefore, he have lived in the united states for about 12 years.  reflecting back, his mother said that giving birth to him was an extremely difficult process;minh was born one week late after the expected due date. his mother was in pain on and off for two days straight on top of six days of continuous stomach aches before he was finally delivered. by that time, her water bag had been almost completely dried. his mother breastfed him and gave him homemade baby food, such as blended vegetables and meat together. however, she told him that when he reached the age of about 2 years old, his main food choices were plain crackers and tofu. he would refuse to eat otherwise until he was around five years old.  minh grew up with his family all of his life, which makes him a very family-oriented person today. minh have two younger brothers named thoi and khai tran. dao the older sister is currently a junior in college, attending uc davis in medicine. thoi is a junior and khai is a sophomore both at thurgood marshall academic no. his siblings and him are very close, he's deeply grateful for a supportive and loving family. he also have a half-brother and four half-sisters as well as an adopted sister. he have a large family because his father was married once before meeting his mother. however, his father's first wife passed away due to prolonged sickness, so his father met his mother after the war and they got married following the birth of the four of them.  minh has been involved in various concerts and live shows, because he's the founder of the au co dance company, au co teen youth group and au co production. it was founded nearly four years ago. the program is designed to help teenagers from all walks of life, to break out of their comfort zones and make a difference in society, even though, it's a vietnamese group. he welcome all people from diverse ethnicities & cultures. they express their teamwork by performing in dance shows throughout san francisco. their latest concert your passport to music & dance was at union square. his determination and drive to learn more and help others are increasing by the seconds.  during his journey in pursuing the arts, he encountered many obstacles. he comes from a family of ten siblings and his parents wanted their children to go into medicine or law. since he was not good at any of those things. he went against his parents' wishes and convinced them that he love what he do

want to briefly share with you my experience and ask to see if you fit the storyline of this movie. it does sound sort of cheesy but, are you one of those single individual that usually stay at home and wrap yourself with a heavy thick blanket and watch your romantic life go by? are you a person that is utterly terrified of talking to that someone you've been having a mad crush for months or even years perhaps? well, if you fit these guidelines than you will absolutely love, love, love, this movie that i am about to review. since the movie is so long and there are so many great features that the director inserted in each of his scenes. i will not be able to cover it all. however, i want to target and share with you about the story line and how he use lighting and sounds to capture the true emotions that each of the characters play as star crossed lover.  are you ready for the name of this movie? okay, well here we go. the movie is call \"dear john.\" its about \"u.s. soldier john tyree (channing tatum) falls for southern college student savannah (amanda seyfried), whose ideals and heartfelt principles are at once attractive and unfamiliar. but their love is put on hold when terrorist attacks prompt john to reenlist. now, handwritten letters hold the lovers together. lasse hallstrom directs this modern romance based on the novel by nicholas sparks.\"  this modern day version of romeo and juliet is very heartfelt and sad. the beginning of this film is very happy and energetic. the director, lasse hallstrom did an amazing job by introducing each of the characters as their own story and uniting them at a beach party. the use of soft music or original sound track is very calming in this romantic comedy. he made us feel about what each of the two character went through before they met each other. the recently wounded solider john tyree played by channing tatum just completed his term in the military as he goes back to his hometown to visit his mentally sick father and then later meets the girl of his dreams.  when trying to provoke the audience emotions the director also try many external factors such as weather. i found that scene very powerful because it sends out messages that what ever john tyree played by channing tatum did as a young child, it will always come back to him in a form of rain drops. because, if we look deep in the symbolism of that one scene john tyree went through a lot as a child. his father suffered with a mental disability called autism and in his entire life as a no student he was the bully and everyone feared him. he later entered the military and was wounded. the entire scene when he was with savannah (amanda seyfried), was at a newly build home that she volunteered at. but, the only thing that was built was the frame of the house. both lovers, hugged and kissed under the rain storm and it was very emotional because the director was trying to send out a message by saying that you should let your barriers down and try to let other people in your life in. that scene was a testimony of trusting other people.  my favorite quote from the film was when john and savannah had a conversation with each other about how other people fears john because he has such a terrifying background. john said \"why do you want to stay with me?, i'm a terrible person, i'm a trouble maker, i'm\" savannah said \"you don't scare me john.\" then john respond with \"well, you scare me savannah.\" that short and simple monologue between both of them really tells us that the director was trying to suggest that no one should judge each other by the way they look but by the way they act and feel.  as the film gets deeper into the climax, and the couple started to really fall in love, savannah had to leave with her parents to their home state and leave john and their vacation home merely as a bittersweet memory. it was hard for both of them to leave each other and this really took a toll on john. which sparked his interests again to reenlist. it was a hard time for all of them, john and savannah was now no longer spending time together every single day and the was terrorist attacking the united states. john didn't know what to do when he was in service.  as much as he tried to forget his one true love. he constantly wrote back to savannah overseas. they wrote for years, and that was his coping stress when he was fighting thousands of miles away. as time passed, john grew older and so did savannah. they both went their separate ways and she eventually married someone else. but, the most ironic thing was that she married a guy with autism. it was to honor john's father that had recently passed away. john sold his father's coin collections to pay for savannah's husband final hospital bills.  it was clear that they could not be together but they will always have those stacks of letters. the director did an amazing job by breaking each scenes and telling that story!  so, if your a hopeless romantic like me, then i totally suggest watching this modern day version of romeo and juliet.", "essay5": "1. friends & family 2. my iphone 3. my laptop 4. my teeth whitener 5. my money (should be #1

i also love to look at hotties of all kinds, males and females. i can have a roaming eye. i don't want anything to do with women other than looking so don't get any funky ideas. lol. :)  i'm faithful though. so even though my eyes roam, i know where i stand. i've never cheated and rather break up with someone than cheat. that's a deal breaker. you cheat, you leave, end of story. i won't do it to you, don't do it to me and we're fine.  i'm funny and sweet. i'm like the golden retriever but way better looking!! :) i will bite you if you touch me the wrong way...or you ask...;) i can be naughty and nice.  i can show you things you never knew and i can learn from you. that's the best kind of relationship you can have, right?

wear hotter clothes, of course! :d  i talk to everyone but i hate old people!! by this i mean of all ages. you could be 25 and be an old fart or 65 and be young at heart! i like going out and doing things! i hate sitting at home doing nothing. i need to get out there and see the world and learn new things!!  i don't take life too seriously at times but that doesn't mean i can't have a philosophical or deep conversation. i like them actually! the truth is, i rather laugh, which i do, every single day. :d it keeps me from getting old. so far, no one has guessed my real age, they still think i'm 26-28. it has to be all that laughing and playing! i recently lost weight too, so that also helps keep you \"younger\" i guess! :)  when i'm with someone i give my everything to that special person. unfortunately, that means i get taken advantage of but i haven't lost hope that there's someone out there for me. i'm currently seeing someone but sometimes i'm not sure about it. that doesn't mean you all get to have a free for all and ask me to cheat, because i won't...but if you can offer a male perspective that'd be great!  i love languages. i've taken on mandarin chinese, portuguese, afrikaans, and someday i hope to actually be multilingual but these things take time...especially when you're doing them all at once! i understand most french, portuguese, and italian. the latter being the most understood. i can recognise chinese characters. i can distinguish between all asian languages, spoken or written. actually i can do that for most languages... i should have been a linguist.  for some reason, i learned to spell british and never changed it. i like it and it isn't broken, so why fix it?

i also love to look at hotties of all kinds, males and females. i can have a roaming eye. i don't want anything to do with women other than looking so don't get any funky ideas. lol. :)  i'm faithful though. so even though my eyes roam, i know where i stand. i've never cheated and rather break up with someone than cheat. that's a deal breaker. you cheat, you leave, end of story. i won't do it to you, don't do it to me and we're fine.  i'm funny and sweet. i'm like the golden retriever but way better looking!! :) i will bite you if you touch me the wrong way...or you ask...;) i can be naughty and nice.  i can show you things you never knew and i can learn from you. that's the best kind of relationship you can have, right?

couch and decompress.  depending on chemistry and connection, i am open to pursuing a long-term relationship, but let's just let good things come along at the pace that feels comfortable for both....... i think that for meeting complete strangers (like here on okc), having an explicit goal of 'happily-ever-after' seems a big leap when just meeting someone new.  if we seem to be on the

spicy, crave variety, and am a card-carrying carnivore, although i've had to learn to temper this tendency and cultivate a relationship with salad in hopes of reducing my volumetric displacement. the list of things i don't like is actually considerably shorter, i.e. haggis, german food, organ meats, overcooked vegetables and boiled meat. i also like to offend as many dietary sensibilities as i can, preferably in one sitting. can i get the gmo bacon cheese vealburger with a side of foie gras and a poached bald eagle egg please?\ninternet connectivity, my motorcycle, friends, spicy food, housecleaners, and affection.  i am discovering that i can in fact live without playcube 360, although i'm still prone to occasional mild recidivism.\nways to make my life easier or more fun, or preferably both. how to draw a million perfectly concentric circles in a square inch. the nature of intelligence. what i can do to improve my relationship with the rest of my species. quantum mechanics, chaos theory, cosmology, the higgs boson, economics, the interconnectedness of the universe, the drake equation as it relates to dating... oh, and sex. that last one seems to come up a

mall.\n-laughter: college almost shocked it out of me, very true story. i thought seriousness=compassion to make change. -sex; fasho -paper (bahaha, i hoard it. carefully. as in i hope to not be featured on \"hoarders\" one day.) i don't know... hmmmmm...what makes me happy... -coffee -a constant list of \"shit to do\" to get/keep my \"shit together.\" -comfortable temperatures. although. i live in a shed... so this is an arguable one for folks who have slept in my shed.... but generally i like to have access to comfortable temperatures. spent a couple weeks one summer in tn: not my style. -water ^for swimming in addition to being essential to life....one thing that makes unbearable temperatures tolerable.\ni'm sure i spend too much time thinking about myself. fuck. i don't know.... down to talk about anything and then i'll probably spend hours after thinking about it, processing, etc.\njust because i do not drink does not mean i am not down to go out... it does mean i'm not too down to close down the bar anymore. plus i have a 9-5 most of the year so sometimes by friday i am tiiiiiired and just wanna chill, smoke something, watch something, eat something....\n\noh i don't know... you're down with the poly thing, you're not offended by 99% of this online depiction of me, you wanna compliment me (i'm a complement whore, who isn't?... i guess some people aren't. not me!), just if you wanna message me, hate on me, whatever: message away!\n", "essays_len": 5913}, {"age": "yes", "status": "single", "sex": "m", "orientation": "straight", "education": "yes",

its inequities i also am inspired by its beauty and can laugh at its absurdities.\nevery day is an opportunity to learn more, give more and live life to its fullest. to serve others with compassion, while being mindful of my own work.  i've been a city girl my whole life (originally from nyc), but am feeling drawn more and more to being in the green and quiet... i\"ve worked in social justice/government work my whole life. painting feeds my soul and without it i'm spiritually starved. meditation and living a spiritually fit life keep me grounded. i have 2 young adult children and am about to be a grandma.... today i get to ask who am i? ... not defined by anything else than what is happening in this very second...isn't this a crazy and absolutely revolutionary way to live life.  hiking, biking, camping, doing my own art work painting, going to art shows, travelling to new places, travelling to old places, the beach, warm weather, hearing good music, sitting quietly (wow, this is new to me), meditating, laughing till it hurts, watching bad movies while eating popcorn with brewers yeast, bbq's, homemade meals, and intimate conversations where i can be vulnerable and trust that i' won't be judged are what i seek in life.... following my heart and spirituality are what guide me.\nbeing a friend, listening, loving and caring. i'm loyal, energetic and love anything thats creative, spiritual, socially conscious and fun.\nmy passion, compassion, dedication, sincerity and my eyes\nfrom pema chodron to octavia butler...historical novels, independent movies,

was a crazy book, and love all of michael pollen's books (love learning about our food industry), into the plex (i like non fiction very much), i also read a lot of tech news and general world news constantly (gotta love flipboard for ipad!).  movies: american beauty, secret of my success, blade runner, eternal sunshine, donnie darko, sidewalks of new york  tv shows (i'm throwing it in): dexter (best show ever), nurse jackie, 60 minutes, modern family (ok, the other best show ever... seriously makes me laugh out loud), mad men, top chef, ted tv (i know, it's web, but still, i love ted), the daily show, big brother (guilty pleasure), so you think you can dance  music: billy joel, sting, michael bubl, hot chip, sia, lily allen, pink martini, skylar grey, nouvelle vague, the beatles, bob dylan, arcade fire, jay-z ....yup, it's all over the place.  food: that's a hard one, i like so many foods! everything from veggies to ice cream, i love good food, not so much junk food. i will try anything at least once.  podcasts (also throwing this one in): anything tech, tons of techcrunch podcasts, npr\nmy iphone, dark chocolate, my bike, my sunglasses, helvetica, and stripes (seriously, i just love stripes)  ...ok fine, i can live without stripes, but then again, i think this question is way more interesting when you answer things besides the basic obvious, wouldn't you agree?\nwhich username/password combination i used for that site\ndrinking something interesting, most likely wine, eating something yummy, probably at a new place or a favorite restaurant, and sitting next to an old friend or making a new one.  that or i'm staying in and relaxing! i actually prefer going out more during the week rather than compete with the weekend crowds. but sometimes, it is what it is.\ni'm not a huge fan of the dating site dynamic. it sets up weird expectations. i like it because you meet people you otherwise may never have met but other than that, it can be very odd. but who knows, my profile is still active so i'm still optimistic at the moment. but keeping it real, i just don't have the patience for shallow people.\nyou are a sweetheart  you shouldn't message me if: you

topics and read them according to my mood.  mostly just polka. if i happen to not be listening to polka it might be no wave, or world music. here is an old list: ministry, secret chiefs, dave douglas, the cramps, boredoms, skinny puppy, talking heads, pelican, the knife, mr. bungle, danzig, russian circles, velvet underground, joy division, parenthetical girls, mogwai, stereolab, nick cave, animal collective, of montreal, godspeed you! black emperor, white zombie holds a special place in my heart, experimental stuff and much more. i love live and eclectic music and i'm probably the happiest industrial music fan ever.  also, i tore my acl to ministry... at burning man.  falafel, cheese, grapefruits, hummus, indian food, spicy stuff w/ a beer, fresh produce, veggie burritos, food that i don't cook.  netflix, naked lunch and all cronenberg, zardoz, all herzog films, repo man, metropolis, journey reel 8, the birdcage, un chien andalou, moon, from beyond, children of men, koyaanisqatsi, little otik, this is england, 28 days later, man with a movie camera, the parent trap, chinatown, 4, kung fu hustle, abre los ojo, battlestar gallactica, arrested development, twin peaks\nnew information, humor- the dark kind, music, travel, a reusable waterbottle, steamy skilled make-outs, exercise . also, enthusiasm. yes, that is eight things. i'm so glad you can count.\npower structures, making things happen, how lasers are to kittens what teflon is to eggs, how much cooler i would be if i played the accordion or better yet if i could train a snake to play one.\nyou'll find me at a dive bar drinking beer, spending far too long picking out the perfect songs to listen to on the jukebox, maybe at a gallery opening, starting a dance party, riding my bike, at a concert, or other interesting event going on in the city. or maybe sitting in a tent in the woods. all entail having fun and smiling. any could be experienced in costume.\ni eat food off the ground, various grounds. i've eaten out of the trash.  i love popping zits, not just mine.  as much as i love my parts (and believe me i do), i have penis envy. god, i just want a day with one!\nyou're smart, warm, spontaneous, fun, comfortable with yourself and have diverse interests. also please have lots of energy and don't be afraid to share your thoughts, vulnerabilities or dinner.  you see and appreciate shades of gray, not just black and white.  you're a burner.  don't double book a date w me and another girl on the same day. everyone will be sad.  sexy people very welcomed, provided that you hit all my other points. i really like smart people.  i pretty much love beards. though, totally not a requirement.  people who are super duper organized, intense neat-freaks weird me out a bit.  also let it be known that i often forget about this site and get busy, you know, living life. i'm not super into long internet communication, and would rather get a beer quickly if i think you seem

also love haruki murakami, particularly norwegian wood. margaret atwood is another author i'm starting to read more of. i really liked oryx and crake.  as far as movies go, comedies are generally my favorites: monty python, hedwig and the angry inch, the princess bride, wet hot american summer. i could probably go on for a while.  my musical tastes are pretty varied. there's the 90s rock i still love from no: nirvana, bush, etc. there's the more recent hard rock: rise against, atreyu, breaking benjamin. then there's the classic rock that everyone loves: the beatles, the who, pink floyd, led zeppelin, david bowie. and there are a some other ones that don't really fit in a class but just speak to me. gogol bordello is a big one. and recently i've really been into metric and the von

mean i know what's going to happen, but there's some part of me that's a little surprised and disappointed when the characters keep making the same mistakes. i don't really know why this is or why i think it's important enough to share first. it could be about my belief in a personal capacity to change for the better. perhaps it's just about my deep dislike of the idea of fate. or maybe my brain just has a fundamental flaw in understanding cause and effect, which probably will not help me in my career in science.  okay, i should probably follow that with a more traditional self-summary. i'm a graduate student pursuing my ph.d in biology (molecular biology when i'm trying to sound impressive). in many ways i fall into geeky scientist stereotypes. i'm book smart and clever but manage to do some incredibly stupid things. i'm a little awkward socially, but most of the time i can venture into public without completely embarrassing myself. i have a fairly dry sense of humor and take pride in being able to say ridiculous things with a straight face.\ni'm four years deep in a five to six year ph.d program at berkeley. most of my time is spent researching lab. the hours are long, but scheduling is very flexible. i don't really know what my long term plans are. i don't think i have the right temperament for research at a top tier university, but i could imagine teaching and running a lab at a small school or perhaps focusing on public policy and science advocacy.\nwell, i guess i must be pretty good at listening and giving advice since my friends like to come to me for that. though i don't really think it's about giving advice. it's about figuring out what they want to do and telling them it's okay to do so. most people know what they need to do but feel like they need someone else to give them permission in a way.\ni'll have to ask around about that one. eyes are generally a common thing to notice; mine are fairly dark. i've also been told that i have eyelashes that make girls jealous. also a strong nose. whatever that means.\nwhen i was younger, i was really into kurt vonnegut. i've drifted away from him a little bit since i've grown less idealistic, but i still have love for many of his books. i tend to go for contemporary fiction. jonathan saffron foer's everything is illuminated is probably my favorite book. i also love haruki murakami, particularly norwegian wood. margaret atwood is another author i'm starting to read more of. i really liked oryx and crake.  as far as movies go, comedies are generally my favorites: monty python, hedwig and the angry inch, the princess bride, wet hot american summer. i could probably go on for a while.  my musical tastes are pretty varied. there's the 90s rock i still love from no: nirvana, bush, etc. there's the more recent hard rock: rise against, atreyu, breaking benjamin. then there's the classic rock that everyone loves: the beatles, the who, pink floyd, led zeppelin, david bowie. and there are a some other ones that don't really fit in a class but just speak to me. gogol bordello is a big one. and recently i've really been into metric and the von bondies, which i guess are indy-ish.  i'm very flexible about food. i can go for chinese, thai, korean, indian, ethiopian, mexican, etc. or just a good pizza. i can find something i like at pretty much any type of restaurant.\n1) some sort of music player should probably top the list. i can get stressed out when i go too long without listening to music.  2) books definitely rank very highly. as long as i'm carrying something big enough to hold a book, odds are i have at least one on me.  3) my computer, of course. can't go too long without the internet.  4) cell phone would probably be a good choice. i'm always worried i'll get into an emergency if i don't have it around. which is sort of weird, since i'm old enough to remember not owning one in no.  5) exercise bike. it's become part of my daily habit and now i feel weird when i don't use it.  6) video games. i avoid mmos after seeing friends get addicted to them in college, but i like single player console gaming for stress relief.\nwell, i spend a lot of time thinking in general. i frequently become lost in thought and wind up staring into space. a lot of times i'm thinking about science. i love trying to think through complicated problems no one has ever really thought about before. though just as often i'm thinking about books or music or just imagining hypothetical scenarios that will never come to be.\nwell, often i'm in lab doing experiments. but i also like to go movies or grab dinner or drinks with friends.\nah yes, the most private thing i'm willing to admit to anyone on the internet who registers for okcupid. anything that fits that criterion clearly isn't private enough to be interesting. coming soon: the most private thing i'm willing to post on a billboard off the highway.\nyou feel like it.\n", "essays_len": 5042}, {"age":

"essay": "i seek eternal happiness and constant hedonistic bliss (interspersed with periods of rest) to share with another.  i am an open, honest, warm and caring person seeking the same. i want to meet someone who shares my interests while accepting me when we are different. this woman (and i know you are out there  just don't know where yet) seeks equality in a relationship and is aware of the needs of another without effort.  i am also looking for someone like me that will make me laugh and challenge my intellect. smart and funny women turn me on. i love beautiful dialogue and thought provoking wit.  i am very patient and am willing to wait to find the woman that is just like me only different. you know what i mean? me either, so please tell me. hurry.  i come from a large catholic family from minnesota but left there 30 years ago (minnesota - i left catholicism 40 years ago).  i have kept some things about myself private for many reasons (mainly gainful employment). some of these questions are too private and personal (all the really good ones) but they are also very important and should be discussed before we meet (so i can be assured that you are not a charlatan in disguise).\ni am reading each day and trying to get outdoors. i am playing most sports and enjoy playing sunday night ice hockey. i ride my bike a lot and am in the water.  i like to take long walks off short piers. i like sunsets in the morning and breakfast for dinner.  note: my partner does not have to play sports but she is active and loves being outside when we leave the house. we might enjoy a bike ride, a secret picnic place, a swim in the ocean or a hike in the woods.  i also love leisure time and value intimacy. a great vacation might be relaxing in an all-inclusive clothing optional resort or skiing down a new zealand glacier (wearing clothes unless it is a special event).  i am separated (two years) and just now begining to date. i have a son that i see  time (every monday and tuesday and every other weekend). he is way above average and brings me much joy.\nself-directed fun (i have that down). i am also an expert at conversation, making another feel special, laughing hysterically and clearly knowing what i have at all times and being grateful.\nmy smile followed closely by my clean fresh scent.\nthe number of books, artists, dishes and musicians that i like is lengthy but here are a few.  i recently love ian pear's \"stones fall.\" great writing and a page turner. 1900 mystery set in europe. great find. i love biographies and am checking out the autobiography of mark twain.  my favorite movies are most certainly anything ethan and joel coen have done. favorite comedies: young frankenstein, caddy shack, monty python and the holy grail. i also like great sci-fi, action and drama with a great story. black swan was very disrurbing but also very thought provoking.  i love taj mahal, amos lee, keb mo, black eye'd peas, john coltrane, bob

someone who does). my two all-time favorite things are camping and going to the opera, but if you share my passion for only one it would hopefully be the outdoors. i am even lucky enough to have a job doing something i'm truly passionate about; i work for a non-profit doing land conservation work in california.\nplanning trips and actually going on them. since college my goal has been to go to a new country each year and i'm doing pretty well at it. i've also planned group trips for my friends to mexico, las vegas, and most recently a weeklong yosemite camping trip with a few days of backpacking. next summer i'm thinking europe. i'm absolutely not a \"type a\" planner, though, so if you're traveling with me we'll get there (and it'll be a blast), just not necessarily in the exact way we might have expected.  i'm also good at doing random stuff and supporting my friends. coworkers bands/independent films, roommates bands/poetry/ugly glitter folk art, friends bands/parades/fire performances/vampire novels/unique entrepreneurial ideas. i won't just say i'll go and then be busy the actual date, i'll show up and have fun and think it's awesome. unless it totally sucks, then i might duck out early.\nmy curly hair and my sense of humor. i hope the second one is the reason i often find people laughing at me, but then again the wind in sf makes it tough for a curly girl sometimes.\nmovies: pulp fiction, ocean's eleven, the big lebowski, the ring, grizzly man, the matrix, amelie, the blues brothers, and groundhog day. i'm also a fan of most things done by quentin tarantino or the coen brothers.  tv: modern family, how i met your mother, csi, law and order, 30 rock  books: a confederacy of dunces, the monkey wrench gang, fast food nation, in defense of food. i don't read a lot of fiction. if it's not painfully obvious from the questions that i value, i want you to agree with me politically so when i read the social science books and rant about religion and politics you'll be ok ranting along with me, or at least content to nod and smile.  music: oasis, yo la tengo, dandy warhols, the black keys, opera, blues, bluegrass, jazz.\nfood, tea, friends, family, cozy socks, and sarcasm.\npolitics, social issues, and what awesome dish i'm going to make for dinner. also i like to ponder how it is that social issues ever get solved when we're all busy thinking about food. not to imply that food is not an extremely worthwhile thing to think about -- maybe i should have put that first, actually.\nout in sf meeting friends for a meal or drink, going to a performance, listening to a banjo in a bar (is it just me or did the world finally hear my suggestion and make banjo cool?), having folks over to play board games, or cooking a meal and watching a movie with my roommate. if it's the right season i'll be heading out of town for a camping or ski weekend.\nwhenever i see people with \"i'm an open book, ask me anything (winky face)\" i always get the urge to message them this question:  would you rather be with the person you love forever but you always have to wear a shirt made out of their pubes? or be alone but you can wear whatever you want.\nyou want to meet up for a hike, a board game, indoor rock-climbing, a drink, or almost anything else. i love trying new things (winky face).  i'm a big believer in the casual coffee date and am still on my quest to find the best soy chai and spicy hot chocolate that sf has to offer.  please also contact me if you have any leads on those.\n", "essays_len": 4574}, {"age": "no", "status":

stewardess of all things refined, a muse for both the scientific and artistic worlds; toying with taste, i rebel to compel :)  i am just emerging from my return of saturn recently so needless to say, there are a lot of changes going on in my life right now. i am originally from jersey, but am relocating to the bay area from the midwest, where i lived for the past four years.  i was born a natural introvert, but social conditioning over the years has helped me embrace my inner garrulousness. my family is from the caribbean so i am not only outspoken with my words, but also my love for others as well. life is too short to deny your self how you feel and who you are.\nenjoying what it feels like to truly live in the present - we live too much of our lives on auto pilot. i am a total geek at heart and am doing a lot of reading on solar power and urban farming lately. music is a close cousin to mathematics so i find that i have a natural affiliation to anything music-related - whether it is making it (i play three instruments and would love to learn more), listening to it (i am into a lot of psy-trance right now, but my heart will always be in classic rock), or supporting local shows.  i love to travel, although right now, the 9-5 job keeps me pretty grounded. i have lived in three different countries and have traveled to about 15 others. i admire how europeans \"work to live\" instead of \"live to work\" as the americans do. i keep myself entertained via active discourse about anything from philosophy to politics to psychology to theology.  i used to hit up a lot of burning man-esque parties in new york so if anyone can help plug me into the burner scene in the bay, that would be awesome.\n- witty banter: improvised, genuine, and playful conversations are like making love with the mind :)  - socializing: i think this comes out of pure survival because of moving around so much. i am looking forward to growing my roots in san francisco now for the time being.  - knowing the best new music to listen to: good music is like oxygen to me - i cannot live without it.  - greeting people: i have been told that i give some of the best hugs and kisses evarrrr.\na presence and charisma that leaves a much larger impression than my physical stature\nfavorite music: a perfect circle, beatles, hedflux, led zeppellin, muse, nine inch nails, ott, pretty lights, shpongle, tool, tori amos, vast  favorite movies: batteries not included, beetlejuice, big lebowski, but i'm a cheerleader, crash, drop dead gorgeous, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, ma vie en rose, napoleon dynamite, return of the king, the last unicorn  favorite books: agony and the ecstasy, american gods, anatomy of the spirit, angels and demons, calvin and hobbes, chronicles of narnia, fear of flying, god of small things, harry potter, mists of avalon, on love, the ethical slut, the unbearable lightness of being, zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance\n- my sometimes overly optimistic outlook on things: call me corny, but i believe in the innate goodness of humanity. 2012 is not about the physical end of this world, but the end of the world as we perceive it today (and i mean that in a good way).  - my vast music collection: i listen to everything from classic rock to jazz to electro to hip hop / soul and everything in between.  - good local ethnic food: i am sooooo looking forward to eating good food again. the people in the midwest do not know what they are missing out on - ahhhh, fresh sushi!  - a vibrant nightlife scene: i love meeting new people and connecting authentically with others.  - my library card: i try to read at least 2-3 books a month - keeps my mind fresh and questioning.  - frequent flyer miles: two big trips planned for next year - international trip to tibet and domestic trip to burning man (my first trip!).\nour deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.  it is our

lawrence of arabia, repo man, alfred hitchcock, wes anderson, coen brothers, bad action/horror movies, the list could go on and on but won't.  as far as food goes i am not a vegetarian, i don't have intolerance for any thing, i'm relatively daring (try anything) love food and am a good cook.  books well to be honest i don't read all that much but i do love the writings of bill bryson (look him up), hunter s. thompson, david sedaris, kurt vonnegut and william s. burroughs.  i love music but i'm not going to make a fucking list about it because i think lists can be boring and it could take all month to make. i will say i'm a musically inclined song writer with a pretty good voice.  i love audio books and radio shows, some of my favorites include radio lab and this american life.\n1

thinks they have a good sense of humor so i guess if you like tasteless jokes that might fit my criteria for \"sense of humor\", also if you think you are too cool for school in all likelihood you're not. pretentious, hyper-judgmental, self-aggrandizing fuckhats need not apply. don't let that last part discourage you. there is nothing wrong with having a chip on your shoulder. i reserve judgment

really out there in our shared virtual reality. i came across these words recently in the second book of the tao by stephen mitchell. in the book, mr. mitchell poeticizes the writings of chuang tzu, an ancient chinese master. without permission, i have edited his words as if they belong to all of us. these are not words of a religion, nor do they prescribe a practice or ritual. they are simply one man's thoughts about our existence. i rewrite them here simply as an offering to anyone who may find meaning in them, as have i.  everything can be seen as a this; everything can be seen as a that. the 'that' depends upon the 'this'; the 'this' mirrors the 'that'. one follows from the other; each is inseparable from both, the same side of the same coin. you can't have right without wrong, life without death, true without false. nothing is absolute, things are the way they are because we think they're that way. good or bad, acceptable or unacceptable, they conform to the way we see them. every point of view depends upon the viewer, affirmation and denial, are equally beside the point. none is more important or more valued that any other. their difference is their completeness. step beyond yourself. step beyond the whole world. step beyond all existence. slough off past and present, enter the place of neither being nor non-being, welcome all things, watch as they come and go, be rooted in now. when you penetrate that far, you will shine with the original brightness.  perhaps as a result, i find my awareness transitioning increasingly from form to formless ....\nliving

to peter gabriel's passion, followed by an amazing brunch... if you want to join me on the dance floor for swing dance lessons or the occasional tango lesson. or... shake your ass to some jump blues from time to time. if you can hop on the back of my bike and go. go away, see the countryside, feel the wind in your face and totally unwind with me. if you follow through with your plans, take calculated risks when needed or desired... if you will not hold back, have barriers, retreat into quietness when troubled... if you want to put some serious roots down and make a family of your own

there is no way to write something about myself in a few sentences that is captivating and genuine without bullshitting or seeming arrogant. this difficulty is increased by the fact that you are supposed to write how great you are without seeming full of yourself. so, here goes.  overall, i like myself and most people usually like me, as well. most of the time, i can be described as kind, compassionate, intelligent, funny, sincere, honest and passionate. there are, however, times when less flattering adjectives apply. hopefully, you'll find the positive attributes so enticing that they outweigh the negative attributes (which i think pale in comparison to the positive attributes, but that's just me).  i am fortunate for many reasons; the number one reason being my 4 year old son. as you can see from his pictures, he is gorgeous. of course, i'm not biased at all. i was reluctant to include any pictures of him for fear it would be construed as exploitation. i finally decided to include his photos because a) he is such a huge part of my life; and, b) i'm not above exploitation if it facilitates me meeting the right person. :)  i am very lucky to have some unique, interesting, smart, funny, supportive friends with whom to spend time.  i usually like my job but there are days when i'd rather be independently wealthy (who wouldn't, right?) i'm a family law attorney, which is a nice way of saying \"divorce lawyer.\" (cue ominous music).  in terms of activities, when i'm not with my son or working, i love to ski, hike, play basketball, go river rafting, hanging out with friends and having drinks, seeing live music, etc. i play the piano (mainly blues) and love wood working.  i love to laugh (who doesn't?); i'm usually pretty funny. i have an overly indulgent sweet tooth (i like to think it is the sweet tooth's fault; not my lack of will-power). i love my family even though they can be certifiably crazy. although i'm confident in many ways, i can still be prone to bouts of neurosis. :)  ultimately, i'd like to meet the right person to share my life with but i'm not in a rush to find her. that being said, if i found the right person now, i'd be open to

here but love to get away - small sleepy towns, beaches and the redwoods. love to camp and don't mind getting dirty. my favorite day consists of a bike ride out to the beach, a six pack and a blanket on the sand and a good dinner at outerlands\nanything with my hands- pretty good at fixing things. i have a incredible knack at making people feel good. and a great kisser which i believe is a very under-appreciated talent\ni am usually the one embarrassing herself and laughing hysterically. i have a nice laugh so no worries, not obnoxious at all.\na lot of non-fiction love wenders, godard and wes anderson sons of anarchy, dexter, the wire, the walking dead arcade fire, radiohead, devotcka, black keys, bon iver to name a few. old french pop cupcakes, pig, watermelon and cherries\nfamily/friends my cat coconut water kombucha bourbon sunshine\ncute men with beards and big hands, healthy eating, the little cottage house i want with chickens in the backyard, an outdoor studio, bbq and dinner parties with friends. relaxation\nevery weekend is a bit different from the last\ni am crazy bad at writing the initial email on this site. i am really good at email 2 and 3, i swear. be a little forgiving???\nyou think we would hit it off, you know what you want out of life, you're motivated and you will never try to convince me that burning man is cool.  i like men who can fix things  and an updated list of things that i believe if i were a guy i would find super cool: 1. i will never ever make you do yoga with me 2. i will never make you watch a musical (promise me you won't make me either) or watch a \"chick flick\". i prefer chick flicks on my nights home alone and yes i will go with you to see some bad sci fi movie that i couldn't care less about because you don't want to go alone. 3. i find jeans and tee shirts way sexier than shirts and ties 4. i won't only order a salad at dinner and will be able to figure out what i want to eat in the matter of a few minutes 5. your guy friends and dad and mom will love me 6. it takes me 30 min to get ready. tops 7. if you catch my heart then i will treat you like you are the coolest, sexiest man alive!\n",

to be there for my partner and let him know that i care and do want to listen to what he has to say. i like to cuddle, again without feeling the need to talk. sharing space and touch while watching tv

than what we do or where we live or what we look like or what we like. it is unfortunate that we limit ourselves to such classifications.  on the less philosophical side, i do like candle-lit dinners and walks on the beach. i enjoy hanging out with my partner and know that there isn't a need to be talking all the time. i like my alone time because i am an introvertbut don't mistake an introverted temperament for anti-social non-activity. i enjoy going out and being active with other people. i just don't need or want it all the time or for hours on end. i enjoy being made to smile or laugh by my partner because it makes me feel special. i like to be there for my partner and let him know that i care and do want to listen to what he has to say. i like to cuddle, again without feeling the need to talk. sharing space and touch while watching tv or reading a book or something is a safe and comfortable feeling.  i hate feeling as if i need to prove something or look a certain way to be liked or loved by another. i like process. i know that i am far from perfect, and i enjoy knowing that i have room to grow and the desire to do so.  don't get me wrong, i like a good final product. but when it comes to me or another person or a relationship, there is no final product. if there is no room to grow or improve or change laterally, then there is nothing interesting there on which to build. i know i need to grow and continually work on bettering myself, and i know that everyone else has room to change. and i know that good relationships are never a finished product. there is always possibility and adaptation and growing, all toward the betterment of the couple and the individuals involved.  i'm looking for a man who is complex and varied. looking for someone who is intellectual, spiritual, active, laid back, sexual, interested in knowing me and challenging me, willing to share himself with me and be challenged by me, interested in trying new things, supportive in all areas of life, encouraging through it all. i like a man who can be a great conversationalist and hang-out buddy, as well as a great versatile top in bed. i like a man who is practicing in his faith, as faith is an important thing for mebut i don't want that to be expressed in a fundamentalist-ish, closed-minded way. i want a man who has varied interests himself, who enjoys doing things with me but also enjoys time away from me doing things that he enjoys and that i may not so much. i like a man who likes to learn and grow, as i do. i want to learn from him as well as share things with him from my own life and experience.\nhave spent most of my professional career as a youth minister/church educator, with some time spent as a theatre educator. i enjoy teaching and working with people in an educational capacity. but i am currently a poor and struggling grad student.\n\nusually my smile. it's kinda toothy.\nmy favorite movies: sci-fi, fantasy, feel-good, gay-themed, action, indie, dramas, foreign films,  favorite television (this is always changing with the seasons): tv is one of my greatest guilty pleasures. there is just a lot i enjoy, and every fall and midseason is a wonderful opportunity to check out more.  my musical tastes: eclectic, from dave patten, daniel boys, justin utley, chris salvatore, jay brannan, lady gaga, mark hildreth, kurt nilsen, musical theatre, jennifer knapp, janice whaley, owl city to benedictine monks, new age-y stuff, world music, and much more in between.  my favorite places:  books i like: sci-fi/fantasy, gay-themed fiction and nonfiction, religious-themed nonfiction and fiction (but not light-hearted fluff that is underhandedly preachy)\nthe internet, television, a pet, sex, good reading material, faith.\nthe trajectory of my life.\nwhat's a typical friday?\ni like a good top. ; )\n\n", "essays_len": 4064}, {"age": "no", "status": "single", "sex": "f", "orientation": "straight", "education": "", "ethnicity":

paul auster, on the road - jack kerouac, in cold blood - truman capote, to kill a mockingbird - harper lee, the great gatsby - f. scott fitzgerald, a prayer for owen meanie - john irving, high fidelity - nick hornby, the alchemist - paulo coelho, hard-boiled wonderland and the end of the world - haruki murakami, the fortress of solitude - jonathan letham (although i thought that the last part of the book was completely unnecessary and had he just stopped before that it might have been a near perfect book), watchmen - alan moore, me talk pretty one day - david sedaris  i like food. a lot. making it, eating it, looking at it, smelling it, taking photos of it. so if you're a vegetarian or a vegan, while i respect your choices, we'd likely not be a romantic match as i like to cook

i'd choose funny. i don't like tv snobs. i love pie more than cake. i'm always the first in the water and the last to get out. i grew up in the diy generation where we made our own zines, our own clothes, our own accessories, and our own fun. actually, none of that has really changed all too much. i own more polaroids, lomos, and holgas than i know what to do with. i have the sense of humor of a 12 year old. penis jokes are always funny. and poo jokes. if i ever meet you, ask me about the shit bag story. i also like golf. but only the miniature version that involves windmills and such. the big kid version bores me to tears. oh, i try to be good. try...\nfull time student. yada, yada, yada. i've traveled places. yada, yada, yada. trying to figure out how to become independently wealthy. yada, yada, yada. or how to get everything i need in life for free or cheap. it's essentially for the same reasons i want to be independently wealthy but may require a tad more work and a ton more charm(which may be my issue).\nfinding humor in just about anything, even at the most inappropriate of times. you could somehow develop leprosy and i'd figure out a way to make you laugh about your sores and boils. trust.  there are a few games that i consider timeless and classic that i'm really good at. they are as follows: 1. answering random questions with \"your mom\". you'll never see it coming, it'll throw you off, and it'll be hilarious. 2. the \"that's your boyfriend/girlfriend game\". juvenile? sure. funny? totally. other variations may include \"that's your mom\", \"that's your grandpa\", or \"that's you in 20 years\".  i'm good at things that have to do with my mouth. eating, kissing, etc. except whistling. i'm a terrible whistler.  being appropriately inappropriate sometimes.  oh, and also, charming the cashiers at 7-11 into giving me winning lotto tickets. though, i only seem to be about 5.00 charming. still nohow to be jackpot charming. **update: i'm apparently now up to being 177.00 charming! that's improvement, m'friends!\nmy lips. i grew them myself.\ni collect records so i listen to quite a lot of different kinds of music. asking me simply what i like would take hours. but let's see if i can't give the short list a go: celebration, elliott smith, stevie wonder, curtis mayfield, clarence carter, ccr, otis redding, nina simone, minus the bear, les savy fav, cat power, willie nelson, ricky nelson, dolly parton, miles davis, john coltrane, blind willie johnson, belle and sebastian, francoise hardy, france gall, hall and oates, tribe called quest, the sea and cake, archers of loaf, sam cooke, interpol, in ribbons, man man, mc5, big star, tom waits, hey mercedes, braid, the rolling stones, the beatles, the kinks, the animals, solomon burke, nick drake, rjd2, yo la tengo, pulp, bon iver, the pixies, the descendents, the dead boys, the magnetic fields, the cocteau twins, rogue wave, madlib and probably a million others but i'm too tired to keep going.  i read a lot and my favorite authors are jd salinger (rip) and paul auster. i'm currently trying to read my way through the strand's top 80 list. notable favorites include: franny and zooey - jd salinger, the new york trilogy - paul auster, the book of illusions - paul auster, on the road - jack kerouac, in cold blood - truman capote, to kill a mockingbird - harper lee, the great gatsby - f. scott fitzgerald, a prayer for owen meanie - john irving, high fidelity - nick hornby, the alchemist - paulo coelho, hard-boiled wonderland and the end of the world - haruki murakami, the fortress of solitude - jonathan letham (although i thought that the last part of the book was completely unnecessary and had he just stopped before that it might have been a near perfect book), watchmen - alan moore, me talk pretty one day - david sedaris  i like food. a lot. making it, eating it, looking at it, smelling it, taking photos of it. so if you're a vegetarian or a vegan, while i respect your choices, we'd likely not be a romantic match as i like to cook for my dates and if you can't eat my braised pork belly buns (think momofuku, not dim sum) then it would just break my heart.  my favorite movies include: the goonies, rad, thrashin', north shore, sleepaway camp, batman - mask of the phantasm, spinal tap, trois couleurs trilogy, oldboy, the city of lost children, children of men, amelie, brazil, waking the dead, election, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, lost in translation, supervixens, and anything kubrick.  favorite tv shows might be a tad embarrassing to list because there's more than i'd like to admit so i'm going to list a condensed version of the least embarrassing ones: arrested development, freaks and geeks, x-files, buffy/angel, firefly, gilmore girls, lost, skins, my so-called life, this american life, gossip girl, golden girls, cosby show, cash cab, true blood, entourage, breaking bad, weeds, mad men, and, of course, top chef.  and i'm a big fan of this american life and npr.\n1. bacon. 2. bourbon. 3. books. 4. b-sides. 5. boning. 6. b'passport. 7. banh mi.\nvietnamese sandwiches, the existence of loch ness and other creatures we've never seen in the deep sea, doing it, how to do it, where to do it, how to survive through and after the apocalypse, which book i'll read next, if my dvr is working properly, what recipe to come up with next, how to get ira glassryan gossling to marry me (sorry, ira, but ryan gossling saves lives!), how to become an alchemist, luchadors, what else i can put bacon on or in.  also, i've noticed that a great percentage of dudes with racially ambiguous profiles tend to be asian dudes. what's up with that?\ndoing something i enjoy rather than doing something i feel i'm obligated to do. so if that means staying in to watch a movie or work on a project (read: baking cookies), i'm good with that. or, occasionally going out and having drinks with friends followed by hunting down the most perfect pupusas in the city (so far el zocalo is in first place), i'm good with that, too. mmm...\nsometimes i think that you can pretty much get just about anything you want if you just ask for it. someone is bound to say yes at some point, right? so for a while i used to ask people if they would give me a piano. i came close a few times, got a few yeses. but they always managed to fall through in the end. so instead, i started to ask people to draw me a piano since i figured it might be the closest i'd ever get to actually having one. at this point i've been doing it for a number of years now and have an amazing collection of drawn or painted pianos done on anything from cocktail napkins to big canvases. i even have one painted on a skateboard. and they've come from so many different people from around the world, from friends to random strangers at the bar or on a plane. i kinda think these pianos have given me more fulfillment than any real piano in the world could.  oh. and i still want to be a goonie.\ndon't be a douche. that's all i ask.  you'll make it to the top of the list if you're an atticus finch that used to be a holden caufield. *swoon*  or you can answer me this: if you were going to make a mixtape for a girl, what would be on it?  bonus if you are looking for someone to make stuff with like art projects, food projects, whatevs. or to play scrabble(send me your words with friends id) or draw something with. or listen to records with. or all of the above, with a side of bourbon.  and i own a rad racing tshirt. because i'm awesome. and you're jealous. or you should be. *see photo*  also, i like stories. double bonus if you tell me a story.\n", "essays_len": 9116}, {"age": "yes", "status": "single", "sex": "f",

composers to list here.  shows: i don't have a tv or netflix but friends fill me in. i really liked the wire and some other hbo shows but i can't stand watching anything with commercial interruptions.  food: i like almost all food if it's cooked correctly. i'm not a picky eater.\nfriends, family, music, books, adventure, beer\nstories.\ni try not to have typical friday nights. i'd just as soon go out on a tuesday.\nhmm. i don't know. i'm not a very private person.\nyou are interesting, friendly, fun and a little bit of a maniac. it helps if you're cute, too, but that can manifest itself in any

town in alaska where we would hang out at the one bar in town after work and then go watch the bears at the dump. another favorite is the greek islands, sitting watching the sunset over the caldera in santorini was a moving experience. i really felt at home in greece, i loved their kefi (which is really hard to translate but basically means something like spirit of joy) and really connected with that. i try to live like a local as much as i can wherever i am. i love having old grandmothers try to talk to me on trains!\ni'm enjoying living in this beautiful, diverse, city full of architecture and culture that i love. i'm also trying to take my culinary skills to a new level, expand them to add as many different cuisines as i can, and have it be more of an art form. and of course try to see as much live music as is humanly possible!  career-wise, i'm at the point where i need to decide whether or not i'm going to stay in the classroom or go for an administrative position. it's a hard decision because i get a lot of satisfaction from being with the kids. i really enjoy watching them grow as young people and as learners. since i teach social studies i am constantly trying to make connections to the world around us and it is truly amazing when i see students start to put what we are learning in history together with what is happening around them.  this is the first summer in a long time that i am not traveling or doing any workshops/seminars so i thought that i would be a tourist here. i want to do all those things that i never seem to get around to doing, seeing some exhibits, eating at some restaurants, generally rediscovering why i fell in love with this city in the first place.\nremembering stupid minutiae that one does not really need to know, awesome for answering random questions, not so good for everyday life.  cooking and baking, it is my retirement plan.....\nmy eyes and my curly hair and my laugh\nbooks: devil in the white city by erik larson is my favorite book, i'm currently reading his new one in the garden of beasts. i will read anything about ancient egypt, greece, or rome, one of my areas of historical passion. fiction-wise, i am trying to read games of thrones but i started it at a bad time and now picking it up again i feel like i need to create a flowchart on my wall.  movies: comedies like old mel brooks, monty python, superbad, forgetting sarah marshall. i am a little bit of a sci-fi geek, i know the difference between the one ring that rules them all and the ring created by the guardians of the universe. i also like a good independent or documentary.  i signed up for hulu plus a couple of months ago just so i could watch stewart and colbert.  music: jack white (in all his incarnations), any decent band from manchester (no really seriously, it seems if a band is from manchester i am programmed to like it immediately), the shins, death cab for cutie, yeah yeah yeahs, metric, gossip, the temper trap, broken belles, of monsters and men, graffiti6, hank williams (and hank iii), johnny cash, billie holiday, a little desmond dekker, edith piaf. i am always looking to hear new bands, i am the kind of person who needs new music, i have my old standbys but i like to add new stuff too. i would love for someone to introduce me to some good hip hop.  food: i am pretty much open to eating anything. i like to cook, and i'm pretty good. i go through cooking phases, this past year i was into french and i worked on my sauces and wine reductions. before that it was italian. i'm searching for my next one, looking around to see what inspires me. those two were by a movie and travel so it can come from anywhere.\nmy kitchen books travel my kid live music technology\ni seem to spend a lot of time thinking about the crazy, random stuff going on around us...\nit depends on what is going on, sometimes going out to dinner or to see music, sometimes staying in making dinner for friends or just hanging out watching a movie.\ni'm addicted to british television. ok and i am a horrible speller, i would say 7% of the words on this profile i had to look up. alright, my ipod looks like some weird amalgamation (yes i had to look it up) of a 13 year old emo girl, a bar in the castro, and a rabid u2 fan...two of my friends and i traded ipod collections awhile back..\nyou are someone who likes to laugh, are passionate about something, and willing to try new things.  i know it is so cliche but i do believe life is all about the journey not the destination. if you feel the same way, that life is a series of adventures to be had, and you are open to taking a few, then you should definitely message me!\n", "essays_len": 5262}, {"age": "yes", "status": "single", "sex": "f", "orientation": "straight",

like taboo and mad libs. i'm also the sort who might find funny-looking vegetables highly amusing.  people fascinate me and i like to dig deep. i value curiosity and thoughtfulness in others and love sharing observations and ideas about our strange little world and why we do the things we do.  i feel very lucky to call the bay area my home, especially after having spent last year in a crowded, southeast asian city. i love wandering through the redwoods with a few crisp apples or one of those crazy green bars you can find at farmer joe's, tossing a frisbee and searching for hidden gems on the beach, walking to my local grocery and filling my tote bags with fresh herbs and produce, juicing things, and lying in the grass with a good spread of cheese and spicy jelly.  i treasure downtime, and love watching offbeat films on my housemate's gigantic projector screen (maybe even better with a bit of wine), playing my piano, or curling up on the couch with a thick novel and a big pot of green tea.\ni spend my days shaping the minds of tiny humans -- nurturing creative potential and perhaps a fascination with vampire rabbits, palindromes, and one-handed pianists.\nbaking thin crust-pizza from scratch and making anatomically correct molasses animals; writing odes and buying talismans for my peeps; keeping my cupboard stocked with crisp apples, fresh vegetables, a little dark chocolate, and at least one unopened bottle of wine that i've never tried before; singing gibberish and turning yawns into musical opportunities; doing downward dog, happy baby, and other silly-sounding poses; playing the piano and collecting an ever-growing assortment of instruments like an angklung and a mouth harp.\ni have a ready smile and big blue eyes. i laugh easily and i'm an honest and loyal friend. i also have a tendency to believe i've lost my keys or cell phone, only to find it in my jacket or overly-pocketed purse five minutes later.\nbooks: the blind assassin, the namesake, unaccustomed earth, unbearable lightness of being, persepolis, kafka on the shore, wild sheep chase, the things they carried, the girl with the dragon tattoo series, lovely bones, the number 1 ladies detective agency, house of spirits, musicophila, and getting things done (my organizational godsend).  movies: a very long engagement, little miss sunshine, hideous kinky, the big lebowski, juno, let the right one in, the brothers mcmullen, the princess bride, mermaids, good hair.  music: mumford and sons, eddie vedder, and neil young (i just recently went to the bridgeschool benefit and was rather mesmerized by these last three), andrew bird, johnny cash, elvis costello, primal scream, girl talk, old jazz standards performed by ella fitzgerald, louis armstrong and sarah vaughan, chopin's nocturnes, debussy, brahms, j.s. bach, granados, philip glass, some terry riley, and it's gettin' real in the whole foods parking lot.  food: crunchy peanut butter on rice cakes, well-spiced lentils, quinoa, all varieties of squash but especially butternut and delicata, grapefruit, fuji apples, papaya with lime, passion fruit, mint chocolate chip and pralines and cream ice cream, baked

before that i was reading \"travel in the scriptorium\" and that was a good one from p.a. even though i believe it does not compare with what he was writing early in his career - i.e \"the music of chance\" or the \"ny trilogy\" but so far the best thing i have read this year is \"kindred\" that i picked up last fall in a small seattle bookshop and that i left lingering around for a few month before getting into it.  regarding the music, my ipod is currently loaded with albums and songs from muse, the white rabbits, leonard cohen, kate nash, interpol, flying lotus, audioslave, toumani diabate and a few good mixtapes.  i don't have \"a\" favorite movie, actually i have one but i am not sure i am ready to disclose what it is here but among the recent flicks i liked are \"synecdoche, new york\", \"before the devil knows you're dead\", \"coraline\", \"no country for old men\" and \"there will be blood\" - just watched a fascinating \"facing ali\" documentary.\na folding knife, double negations, bikes, oysters, words and ideas, oysters.\nwhat would happen if i were riding my motorcycle in total darkness almost as fast as the speed of light and of a sudden i turned on my

why i really should be playing resident evil iv instead of finishing that memo i promised my boss i'd finish over the weekend.  finding my way around. for instance, are you lost in cairo and stuck because the subway map is entirely in arabic? no problem! it turns out that i know exactly two letters of the arabic alphabet, which i guarantee will somehow prove to be the exact two letters i need in order to figure out which train to get on to get to where you want to go.\ni couldn't really say, since nobody's actually told me before.  if i had to guess it would be either a) the fact that i have a shaved head, b) the fact that i wear glasses, or c) my tattoos. of course, it could also be something completely random and unrelated to who i am as a person, like the color of the shirt i'm wearing that day, or possibly that i forgot to shave (it happens).  really, this is kind of an odd question, no? how many of us non-narcissists go around asking people \"excuse me, could you please tell me what the first thing you noticed about me was?\"\nobviously this changes depending on my mood, but lately it's anything by: dosoyevsky, salman rushdie, david sedaris; alfred hitchcock, the cohen brothers, wong kar-wai; any kind of music that's well-written, well-performed and isn't \"new country,\" pretty much any type of food that's prepared by a professional (i've drawn the line at many things i've seen throughout the world, but so far there's nothing i can think of that i've seen on a menu in sf that i wouldn't at least try ... except maybe natto - i hate natto).\nin random order:  -sunshine -food -friendship -music (esp. blues and jazz) -scotch (single-malt preferred, but blends are ok too) -my dog\n-what i want to be when i grow up -where i want to travel to next -wishing i could speak ten languages (give or take a few) -whether i should have been an archaeologist after all -trying to understand music theory (new to me) -my next tattoo -how to make food taste good without using butter (still not convinced it's possible)\neating asian tacos and creme brulee at off the grid?  seeing a movie at the roxie?  drinking beer/eating sausages at toronado/rosamunde?  decompressing at home with a nice single malt and a coltrane album?  in the colder months zeitgeist is ok on a friday night because it's less crowded. drinking beer wearing gloves and a scarf is perfectly fine by me.  i realize it sounds absurdly cheesy, but every now and then i'll escape from the nighttime crowds and go to ocean beach to just sit and stare.\ni've been known to baby-talk to dogs.  i never bothered to get a driver's license (grew up in the city and was just too used to taking public transit to care about driving).\nyou're interested in having real face-to-face friendships with people. i just don't have the patience for trying to construct friendships entirely online. it feels like a waste of time to me, especially in san francisco, where there's so much fun stuff to do out in the real world.  you're open to spontaneously going out for drinks or a bite to eat without a preconceived expectation of it meaning something more than passing the time.  i'm interested in making new friends (with or without \"benefits\"), so from my point of view there's no need for adding the extra layer of pressure of something being a \"date.\" if there's a spark, great, let's explore it. if not, then a good conversation over a couple of beers is great too.\n", "essays_len": 5727}, {"age": "yes", "status": "single", "sex": "m", "orientation": "straight", "education": "yes",

and on and on and on food: mexican, thai, japanese, italian, middle eastern, korean, ummm just about anything yummy and made with care and decent ingredients\ntea (black - pref assam and ceylon - with a dash of whole milk), the sun, bodies of water, cute critters, curiosity, and interesting people. also friends, fun, and creativity. and on and on....\nmy next adventure!\ni'm not known for being ms. routine. could be out on the town or home catching up on the daily show or en route to a weekend hike and bike fiesta.\nhmmm, then it wouldn't be private, would it?  ok -- i love a great sense of

getting \"wow! you look so much more attractive than you do in your photos!\" i guess i'm not that photogenic. :)  my smile, energy, confidence, physicality. i am a very happy person in general. people are often surprised that i walk down the street with a smile on my face. before people see me, though, i think they see my energy--which is abundant--playful, and sometimes intense. intensity is something i always notice about people. i am very drawn to it.  another thing people comment to me about is my confidence. a very good friend once asked me how he could develop the kind of confidence i had, wondered what my secret was. i told him that i had been put down a lot growing up and that it forced me to find things that i liked about myself and to focus on those as if my life depended on it. in addition, i found that there were quite a lot of things that i was naturally interested in and motivated to develop skills in, some of which were terrifying, like speech and debate, singing, writing and acting. eventually i developed a sort of confidence based on real world skills, and--after having had a long look at my flaws--committing myself fully to becoming a person that i liked.  the physicality is innate. i am very kinesthetic; i like to learn anything movement oriented, whether it is dance, martial arts, comedy, massage. i am very body-centered, like to stretch, feel comfortable, challenge myself. i haven't been a runner for many years but every so often i like to sprint down the block just to get that feeling of flight and to test myself to see if i can still do it with ease and grace. i love to move and feel totally free in my body. that to me is the gift of vibrant health. it takes care and maintenance, but feeling strong, agile and relaxed is the cornerstone to a healthy life.\n:: books to kill a mockingbird | illusions: the adventures of a reluctant messiah | pride and prejudice | tao de ching | peaceful warrior | holographic universe |

documentaries, quirky comedies, historical films, dramas. i love going to film festivals to see things i wouldn't see otherwise. i love indie films, but i'm not above going to see casino royale or another well-made blockbuster.  :: music really loving citizen cope, arcade fire, a.c. newman, adrian sherwood, feist, gary jules, chemical brothers, mos def, outkast, phoenix, katie melua, kanye

studied voice and sang with an a cappella madrigal group. i still love to sing and play music with friends.  :: food it's so hard to pick favorites, but here goes: southern fried chicken, galbi (korean short ribs), humbolt fog, a simple spaghetti with tomato/garlic/basil sauce, three-layered vegetable flan (beet, carrot, spinach), matzo ball soup, bastilla (moroccan meat pie), spanish mackerel sushi, anything at humphry slocombe....\nsilliness generosity exercise sex books gravity\ni think a lot about epigenetics, string theory, and the intersection of technology and alternative health.\nwatching roller derby, making dinner with friends, dancing argentine tango, attending a gallery opening, or staying home to rest from the week. ah home, my quiet sanctuary. i love being home.\ni can pick up a pencil with my toes. i have very talented feet and i see no reason to bend to the floor when i can instead practice my toe dexterity and balance. and i think i'm in love with a talking dog who babysits an infant with a snide english accent.\nwhat i'm looking for now: meeting new people. connection and friendship is paramount. if we enjoy each other's company and are fascinated by the conversations they are having, then we'll certainly become friends. if there is attraction, perhaps more than that. i am a realist. true friendships and relationships take time to build. i'm willing to wait for the right person to share a life with. until then, i'm up for checking out new restaurants, going on hikes, exploring the city, any fun thing you can come up with. dating with no pressure for more would be my ideal right now.  what i'm eventually looking for: a partner in crime to explore with. i am looking for someone healthy and fit, grounded, unpretentious, hardworking (meaning: working smart), who is willing to build a relationship that is stable, lasting, passionate and fun. a good partner for me would be someone who is really fit and physically active, intellectually curious, spiritual and very kind.\n", "essays_len": 9994}, {"age": "yes", "status": "single", "sex": "f", "orientation": "straight", "education": "yes", "ethnicity": "white",

i want to make my baby laugh and smile i want him to do the same for me sometimes it will be hard sometimes it will be easy.  romantically i'm a slow bloom looking for a connection, shared ambitions, love... who knows when that will arrive, so for now it's all for fun.  i operate in the world with a lot of critical openness. i have a huge appreciation for expression and the ways in which people hip check the status quo. a friend told me i take risks in order to see how beautiful life can become.  i can kiss and laugh at the same time. i like to relax and be thoughtful. i like being able to move between my body, brain, and heart. i am easily talked or talking into projects/trouble/adventures.  i was raised in an outdoorsy rad family in the northern rockies. i'm a nature freak. +2 weekends a month i'll be gone from the bay area playing somewhere. i have a lot of strange and beautiful places to show someone. i moved here for the culture. it took me awhile but i've developed a lifestyle that feeds my inner urbanite as well as my inner naturalist. i am hugely independent maybe to a fault, but in my relationships i work hard to be considerate and communicative. i am willing to add to and take away some aspects of my current lifestyle for a rad guy. in terms of outdoorsy stuff my baseline is that you absolutely must believe that global warming is real. if you think its a hoax you won't like me.  i'm a designer, interested in art, play, concepts, urbanity, projecting ideas into the future, sustainability, and self education. curious, playful, creative, sincere, gentle, analytical and intuitive, optimistic, simultaneously shy and warm and friendly.\ni'm freelancing in sustainable design, with a lot of time for playing. the most concise way of answering this question would be to say that i'm nurturing growth, all kinds.\nbursting my own bubble. pulling people onto a dance floor. not giving up in difficult situations, i can laugh at myself and stay calm. recognizing other people's strengths. patience. power tools. pie and salads. parking tickets  my friends, unconventional in a variety of ways: anal but not banal designers, environmental activist sweethearts, optimistic union and social workers, beautiful weirdo artists, rowdy rock n rollers, lots of male friends, lgtb's, etc. i need to end up with a partner who will treat them respectfully. if that's not your cup of tea then i can't be your honey.\npeople always say they miss my laugh. curvy red head, kind of pale, dimple, and i have a bump on my nose. i get called sweet a lot, which hilariously, is a good way to make me mad.\nlobbying away our security and health. http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7387331n&tag=contentmain;  i grew up on a farm and have a farmers pickiness about quality. i avoid industriized meat. cooking with friends = :)  i read for pleasure. i love to be read to and with. i like authors who have a beautiful sense of language and description (toni morrison, arundhatni roy, italo calvino, mccarthy, rumi...) blogs and some magazines.  movies: yes please. i am skeptical only of block buster fluff.  music: records. anything with a beat you can dance to (!) this song seems appropriate: http://www.myvideo.de/watch/6367094/prince_kiss steve reich, phyllis dillon, amadou and miriam, joe strummer, cee lo, salt n pepa, deerhoof, oh and lately i'm loving the soul revival: quadron and ubiquity records. so yeah that's all over the map, fun!  extras: planned parenthood, minimalism, podcasts, color, light, science, invention.  i dislike: cancer, michelle bachmann, sarah palin.\ncreativity a good music scene connection to something (a place, ideas, people, anything. as long as i am reciprocating with something.)\nmy next dream-project. kid furniture gybing the human experience ok is oddly fascinating, the things people say on here are heartening and optimistic, thanks for that. how will online dating evolve? it's only going to get better, what if someday \"they\" figure out a way to electronically transmit pheromones. would we immediately be able to find our perfect match? or would we be tempted to be spurned admirers doomed to only browse online the photos of our crushes while we get high on the electric signature of their \"chemistry\"\ni would love to hang out next to a stack of records and play songs all night.\ndata mining gives me the creeps. although by being on here it's kind of what i'm doing. algorithms are bunk. i'm too lazy on here to correct small spelling and grammar mistakes, if you think that is annoying or unacceptable you might find that you are very compatible dating a computer, or wait, is that what we're doing? :) okc's logo gives me flashblacks to advertising for barbie in the eighties. the gd on here makes me think it's marketed to teenagers, oh well. ok this is a weird one but i'm gonna say it anyway: everytime i meet someone in real life i first contacted on the internet i imagine the sound of symbols crashing. why? because, the point where reality and fantasy converge is noisy. my 89 pick up truck is an experiment in rust, theives are repelled by it, i adore it. i worry that i'm gonna have to rip it soon :(\nyou'd like to meet me.  non-romantically i'm looking for intermediate wind surfing buddies.  ***if you're a sound guy, id love to play with your toys, i did some radio theater a while ago and i really miss manipulating sound ***need any help with sand casting glass? know anyone who does?  i am hopeful that i'll meet someone and it will evolve romantically, but really i don't give a fuck if it takes a turn for the romantic. if sparks don't fly i'm open to friends, collaborators, and co-conspirators, just the weirdness of internet connections is enough to keep me playing... anyway, like i said above, i really don't give a fuck. now i mean that literally. getting lucky on an okc date for me, is not a fling but a kiss.

river's edge, party girl, harold and maude, bright star, muriel's wedding, the straight story, almost famous, city of lost children, diner, dancer in the dark, dazed and confused. that being said, i also dig showing movies on a screen in my backyard. this summer's features included american movie, dark crystal and some like it hot.  i'm pretty much a foodie and like exploring. i have a strong affinity for asian food (thai, korean, vietnamese, indian, burmese, japanese, etc etc), but my tastes run the globe. i also have a love of the local food movement and all it inspires. i mostly eat veggies but also seafood and fish from time-to-time. i don't like the way full-on meat makes me feel and haven't eaten it (on purpose) since i was 20.\nsome gerunds: traveling laughing sharing listening loving thinking  of course, i would be remiss if i didn't acknowledge my addiction to npr and various npr podcasts (this american life, radiolab, the moth, and to a lesser degree the splendid table), caffeine and alone time (i have a deep love of people but i definitely have a need to be by myself from time to time).\nthis crazy world we live in and all its many facets, where to seek my next adventure, how to be good to myself and to others, what my next creative or crafty project will be, how to live my most meaningful life.\nhappy houring.... cooking and chilling.... hanging with friends... seeing a show.... heading out of town.\nwhile my music tastes are quick eclectic and wide-ranging, i had what we'll call a \"phish period.\" :)\nyou are smart, fun (perhaps charmingly dorky?), like to do cool stuff (the kind of cool stuff is negotiable, i have a lot of interests), like to engage with folks on more than a superficial level, are compassionate and enjoy people (or are at least as perplexed by them as i am). you like parentheses.  i am a huge fan of random encounters that lead to intrigue and hilarity. turning strangers into friends is cool.\n",

promising relationship. i'm leaving my profile as-is. messages are still welcome, but my dance card is pretty full.  i'm a cuddly polyamorous geek asshole. if that turns you off, you might as well stop reading now.  why do i think anyone would be interested in an asshole? first of all, evidence indicates that lots of people are involved with people who are generally thought of as assholes. obviously, i don't think that being an asshole is my only trait, and i have a fairly extensive history of good long-term relationships. i currently have three partners: i live with my primary partner of eighteen years; i have a local secondary that has its fifteenth anniversary in fall 2010; and i have an ldr secondary that celebrated its fifth anniversary in summer 2009. i also have one ex-partner that lasted more than a decade. i don't think anyone would characterize any of my partners as meek, so it's not like they're just settling for an asshole.  i think the reason i have good relationships is because (to paraphrase one of my partners) i am neither nice nor kind, but i am considerate.  i think of myself more as a curmudgeon than an asshole, but i'm well-aware that \"asshole\" is the label most people stick on me, so it's convenient to just use their language. *shrug*  right now, i'm mostly looking for a local long-term secondary relationship because my local secondary is going to eventually become an ldr, but i'm open to more casual relationships. definitely no more ldrs, though. i have a poly agreement with my primary, which among other things includes a veto before a relationship gets well-established.  my gender identity and orientation is \"straight but not narrow\". that is, i'm a heterosexual cisgendered male who is a bi-cuddleslut. i'm also into performance genderfuck, but that's more about feminism and queer politics; i wear \"gender-appropriate\" clothes 99.9% of the time (read: clean geek attire) and i'm using this photo to weed out people who are repulsed by men in skirts.  i'm an atheistic agnostic and i'm anti-spiritual, but i do believe in murphy and asphalta. (the reason i'm an athestic agnostic is because i'm an agnostic who lacks the courage of zir convictions.) note that i mostly respect other people's religion or spirituality, except for crystal newage woowoo.  i'm a socialist libertarian: i think that neither socialism nor libertarianism is a good model by itself, so i take what i think of as the best parts of both. i'm a strong believer in civil liberties (including queer rights), and i think the government should butt out of personal lives (i support drug decriminalization even though i've never touched any illegal drugs); i support the rkba (and the rkab); i believe in universal health care, housing, food, and education; i believe the government should do more to force companies to pay the true environmental costs of their activities. i believe in capitalism but think that corporatism has run amok; i'm a member of the national writers union (a chapter of the uaw).", "essay1": "i think i'm pretty boring, really. i mostly just hang out with my partners.  i'm dealing with being an extrovert forced into some introversion because i'm deaf.

(edit 2/2009: we decided to let our subscription to consumer reports lapse because we're sick of the pro-diet, anti-obesity ranting.) (edit 11/2009: we let our subscription to bitch lapse because it was insufficiently anti-diet for a feminist magazine.)  i'm a lazy activist. i mostly just try to espouse my positions in my conversations, which includes things like using gender-neutral pronouns and refusing to use \"wife\". in addition to feminism and queer politics, i'm also an ally of the haes movement (health at every size).  i don't watch broadcast tv; the tv is just a monitor for dvds. (i hate those icky bugs and other screen interruptions.) i do watch some tv shows when they're available on dvd and have closed captions or subtitles. the only tv show i've really followed since i dropped out of college was b5.  i have a job i like, a python programmer at an internet startup that isn't eating my life (mostly). i hang out on-line a lot, but i'm an old fogey when it comes to the internet: i don't do web-based fora (such as livejournal or facebook), i stick with e-mail and usenet; i've added instant messaging as a substitute for ytalk.

(the reason i'm an athestic agnostic is because i'm an agnostic who lacks the courage of zir convictions.) note that i mostly respect other people's religion or spirituality, except for crystal newage woowoo.  i'm a socialist libertarian: i think that neither socialism nor libertarianism is a good model by itself, so i take what i think of as the best parts of both. i'm a strong believer in civil liberties (including queer rights), and i think the government should butt out of personal lives (i support drug decriminalization even though i've never touched any illegal drugs); i support the rkba (and the rkab); i believe in universal health care, housing, food, and education; i believe the government should do more to force companies to pay the true environmental costs of their activities. i believe in capitalism but think that corporatism has run amok; i'm a member of the national writers union (a chapter of the uaw).\ni think i'm pretty boring, really. i mostly just hang out with my partners.  i'm dealing with being an extrovert forced into some introversion because i'm deaf. (i'm not deaf; i was hearing for most of my life, i have a cochlear implant now, and i know zero sign language.) mumbling doesn't work for me, nor does talking too fast. if you don't speak clearly, we probably won't work out.  i read. i read a lot. i generally go through two or three library books per week (we don't have any more shelf space to buy books). i mostly stick with speculative fiction, but i branch out a fair bit. i also have several magazine subscriptions, including business week, science news, consumer reports, and bitch. (edit 2/2009: we decided to let our subscription to consumer reports lapse because we're sick of the pro-diet, anti-obesity ranting.) (edit 11/2009: we let our subscription to bitch lapse because it was insufficiently anti-diet for a feminist magazine.)  i'm a lazy activist. i mostly just try to espouse my positions in my conversations, which includes things like using gender-neutral pronouns and refusing to use \"wife\". in addition to feminism and queer politics, i'm also an ally of the haes movement (health at every size).  i don't watch broadcast tv; the tv is just a monitor for dvds. (i hate those icky bugs and other screen interruptions.) i do watch some tv shows when they're available on dvd and have closed captions or subtitles. the only tv show i've really followed since i dropped out of college was b5.  i have a job i like, a python programmer at an internet startup that isn't eating my life (mostly). i hang out on-line a lot, but i'm an old fogey when it comes to the internet: i don't do web-based fora (such as livejournal or facebook), i stick with e-mail and usenet; i've added instant messaging as a substitute for ytalk.

knowing more about me, message me and i might just respond. ;)  ps: i have a kitty, her name is bella, and shes the greatest. no one whos ever met her has been able to argue that.\ni am almost done with school. i have about 3/4 of a year left, but i am taking this summer easy to give myself a break and to focus on a new job i just scored with a friend of mine.\nim really good at making people laugh. im a complete goofball. i love to make a fool of myself as often as possible, and everyone seems to love it. i guess ill keep it up!\nmost peoples first impression of me is that i am very outgoing. im usually very loud, even around people i dont know, and i really dont care if i scare them off or not. if you dont like me then fine, i dont need you anyway.\ntoo difficult to answer. i just love too many things.\nmy kitty, bella my daddy my grandma ruth my best friend chocolate bars salt and vinegar chips real new york pizza rainy days the ocean  i think i went way over 6 things, but like i said, i love too many things.\n\nfridays are usually pretty chill for me. my go-out-and-have-fun nights are usually thursdays and saturdays, but sometimes fridays can get a little wild.\n\nplease dont write me a one-liner message. i promise i wont respond.  also, i probably wont write you back if your profile is lacking. unless you write me an incredibly cute message that i just cant resist!\n", "essays_len": 3002}, {"age": "yes", "status": "seeing someone", "sex": "m", "orientation": "gay", "education": "", "ethnicity": "white", "income": "-1", "job": "", "location":

needs to get inside\". todd's mother is not a very patient woman and things soon escalated to the point where she was yelling louder than i had ever heard her yell before.. \"this isn't funny todd! open this door right now!\" at this point, i started laughing hysterically and said out loud to myself \"you show her todd\".  i can't see over the fence but i imagine her to be an ape like woman

her, ever.. and even now didn't hear him laughing- the kid was straight ignoring her.  this went on for about 45 minutes, impressive by any jerk's standards. i am sure that poor kid took a major beating for locking his mom out of the house for almost an hour that day. but i can only imagine the freedom he must have felt inside the house.. the power he knew he had over his mom and the pride in himself for not being intimidated by her threats.  so here's the get down todd's mom, you may have a tiny son now that you constantly bully around and are a jerk to but he's only going to get older

friends. fortunately, i have an amazing group of each.  my family spends time in the summer at a vacation home on a ranch in the mountains in oregon. i'm very close with my parents and my older sister and her family -- i love being an aunt to my niece and nephew (see photos). we all get together two or three times a year and eat, drink and laugh until all hours.  i have been lucky to experience many different places: college in the midwest, france during and after college (a brief stint working for us soccer before and during the '98 world cup). in no i lived in finland (they really do take naked coed saunas there) for a summer and spent another summer working with autistic children and dolphins in the florida keys, and got my diving certification all in the same summer.  i am drawn to men who are determined and focused...add a sharp wit and a great smile and you've got my attention. a guy who does not take life or me too seriously. i find confidence (not arrogance), athleticism, intelligence and thoughtfulness extremely attractive. someone who enjoys their work, loves new experiences, and appreciates a balance between independence and togetherness. i hope you can fix things

second attempt at on-line dating; i'm still telling the stories about the first attempt - and since i have a healthy sense-of-humor all the stories are funny. i think my self-summary is going to be nearly as gnarly as the first time around. there are a lot of \"i\"'s in this - which i usually try to avoid - but this is a self-summary.  a friend suggested i write a summary that made me sound like a classic car. i was cracking myself up trying to describe my body, engine and interior and so nixed the idea. what i learned from this though was that i am 1) easily self-amused and 2) fairly self-deprecating.  a good thing to know about me is that my family and friends are easily the best things in my life. they are a lovely group of people, and always worth the effort. i love hearing an anecdote about my nieces and nephews, revel in the successes of my siblings and friends and appreciate all that they offer.  another helpful item to know is that i am intellectually curious; i like to understand how something works (sometimes taking it apart), how a person thinks through a problem or issue, how a business manages itself to success...and the list goes on. it's not so much i need the answers, i just like the process of finding the answers.  an additional item that may be helpful to know is that i've never been married and i'm not regretting this or looking to make up lost ground. when i was younger i just wasn't ready and knew i wasn't ready; i needed to do some growing up first. i was given the opportunities but i didn't take them; they were the right choices at the time. i've had some lovely long term relationships - and plenty of time on my own as well. i'm interested in meeting new men and going from there; if it works out great, if not, i think it will be interesting regardless and am happy to have another valuable friend.  a few other good things that might be helpful to know; i'm athletic; running, yoga and whatever new activities that piques my interest, short-ish brown hair, green eyes, and fairly pale (my mother is irish). i'm well-read enough to hold my own with people more educated than i am. i'm smart enough to know that i'm not that smart. i am very observant.  i was brought up in ohio and credit a lot of my grounded nature to my mid-west upbringing. i have the negotiating skills that come with being the middle of five children  and an attitude that is may be an outcome of being raised with boys. i'm quite feminine but i just don't take myself too seriously.  according to some of the 'personality' tests i'm an even split

control.\nvariety humor da fam boys mexican food mexican beer\nboxers or briefs cowboys dennis rodman arrival time: muni vs. walking\nprobably not taking a serious look at my life decisions over a
