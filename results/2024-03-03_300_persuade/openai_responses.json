{"essay": "Although schools said students should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students are not learning enough, actually students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students have more time to sleep and the opportunity of more healthy food.\n\nSome schools said students should not attend to classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students are not learning enough. For example, a\u00a0teacher said students are more lazy and Generic_Name said students don't take classes seriously. In my opinion I think that taking classes at home will be a big problem because students don't do what they supposed to do and also some time students just look at Google to answer what the teacher told to them. Students are not working hard to get want they want, some just said i want to be this or that but they don't put effort in on.\n\nSchools believe that students who take classes at home by way of online or video conferencing are not learning enough. For example, people think students become more interested in other things because they are at home and they can do whatever they want. Generic_Name said that students don't do homework when they attend to an school ,they will not do it at home either. In my opinion all that this people are saying is true because students don't see that what they are doing now can affect they life in the future, because if they to have a diploma they will never have a good job. I think that those schools that want students to take classes at home are making students to be more lazy than they are.\n\nAlthough some schools said students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students need more time to sleep. A reason is that students need to rest they mind so students can be prepare for the next day of class. Another reason is that students need to sleep at least 9 hours because they always went to bed late. In my opinion students need to sleep well because it is good for our self to sleep the correct hours not too little and not too much.\n\nAt this time some schools offer a distance learning program that will let students attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students can eat more deathly food. A example is that the president said that all the students have the right to have a good nutrition. A doctor also said students need a good nutrition because having a good nutrition students can absorb all the learning process. In my opinion this is a good idea because student can have a better nutrition at they on home. Having a good nutrition will make students more strong and they will be able to do many things.\n\nIn my position i think students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students will never put interest in what the need to do. This idea will just cause problems because is a lie that students will be connected to computer to take the classes. It is not the same to take classes at home that at school because at school students can ask the teacher if they have a question and teacher do what ever she/he need to do to make sure students understand it. To give students the opportunity have classes at home is like give students the option to take classes or not. I believe that finishing schools is a great goal in life is like the firth step to more big stuffs.\n\nSome schools said students should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students are not learning enough. I think that is the best because is not good for the students to take classes at home. Those schools who believe students should not take classes at home is because they want the beast for all the students.", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}

{"essay": "Some benefits the\u00a0students have it in many ways\n\nI think , in my opinion to take class in online thats not good ways for learned. Because it is so dificult for they understand what the teacher is talk about it is there when they became confused and dont have it any benefits for them\u00a0. This so new for them this is making that the students take time to assimilate\u00a0what the teacher say it and learining . There is when the teacher become teach it they dont know what they doing because they don't have the cofidence we they teachers because you feel weird to talk we someone you dont know\u00a0.

Some student have some troubles with the language, because they dont know english this making they become confused, and some of them fell the class because dont talking they can not expressing they self to talk .\n\nAnother it is because the student , at home attendent be more lazy's and have more trouble to concetrated. Because they have more distraction , At home this why I think have class in online have consecuencies because they dont learning any they have distracion eg, som distracion are phone, taking, and tv .\n\nSecond reason , some student's can not assimilated what teacher's say it because have problem with the internet in dont is clear what they talking .

If you will stay at home you won't know what are you doing correct and what you are doing wrong.\n\nHow much you learn and read more the better because learning and reading takes you around the world. Teachers should also watch every student\u00a0more carefully because if a student is\u00a0doing something wrong then teachers can help them and make sure they go in the correct way. Parents should also keep an eye on their\u00a0student that how they are doing because if they are not then parents can also guide them.\n\nSo, I conclude by saying that it is better for every student to get education at school instead of getting at home.", "sex": "m", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "asian"}

{"essay": "Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Although I do think that it really depends whether or not the student will take the classes seriously or will play around with the free extra time. I think it would still be beneficial.\n\nFor example,if a student wants to participate in an extra curricular activity that requires traveling the student can't do that unless he or she is taking classes online.\u00a0However,If a student decides to take online classes but does not take extra activities then there is no reason for he or she not to attend regular\u00a0school. For example,\u00a0I personally struggle with this issue. I take modeling and acting as an\u00a0extra activity outside of school. Being signed to an agency is hard because that requires me to travel to different states. Meaning I miss a lot of days in school, which makes it even harder because when I come back from a trip I'm usually behind and confused in classes.\u00a0Although, I\u00a0do miss a lot of school I still manage to pass and have good grades in my classes by self advocating for myself and explaining,and working something out with my teachers. However I do think that if I was in online school I would be able to travel more and have plenty more jobs. While still being enrolled in the school system. This is why I think that schools should offer distance learning options. It would really be helpful for students with extra Activities.", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}

{"essay": "Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. I personally think it's a bad idea because you won't get that much help, do stuff individual, and won't be the same as attending school.\n\nIf students wants to attend classes from home. Well I recommend not to because you wont get any help from the teachers. yes, you can call and do a video conferencing but it just wont be the same. For example, there was this one time that i was sick for a week because of the flu. So I emailed my teacher what I miss and her respond is to look it up on teams. Like how am I suppose to know what to do. And she wasn't any help at all. That's why its a bad idea to not attend at school.\n\nAnother reasaon why I think it's a bad idea to attend classes from home is that we do stuff individual. At school we have the option to work in a group with people to do our work sometimes. For example, lets say that the teacher let you work in groups. And you're in a group of four. Well some of us dont have to do everything. That's we have to do a little to cooraporate with the group. Meaning you don't have to do the work by yourself. That's why it's a bad idea to stay at home and do work by yorself.\n\nThe last reason why I think it's a bad idea is beacuse it won't be the same as attending school. You could also stay in a club or do sports. School is the best way of learning new things and socialize with people. They also havve soccer games and dances that you can go to. Plus you can get some good food from the cafeteria. That's why they should attend school.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it's a bad idea to attend classes from home. By staying at home you won't get stuff done. Won't even have frinds to talk too and maybe not understanding some work.", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}

{"essay": "Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. If students are able to attend to classes from home by way on online or video conferencing it is a good choice, because students can have more time to spend with your family, students are able to do other such of things while they are doing something, and also students can travel to different places.\n\nFirst, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some students when they have classes by online they save more time for them and for their family. For example, my sister PROPER_NAME was going to normal classes at school but she did not want to go to school anymore so she decided to attend to classes by online, when she was taking her classes by online she noticed that she had more time to spend with her family, because when she was going to school she never had the chance to spend time with her parents like she does now like; by going shopping, visiting other families, etc. now she can go with her parents and do fun stuffs. Sometimes she also have the chance to go to parties with her friends, but before going out somewhere she always needed to finish her work and take her classes.\n\nNext, some schools offer distance learning to attend to classes by way of online. Students are able to do other such of things while they are doing something. For example, my cousin PROPER_NAME is taking classes online because she needed to take care of her one kid at home, one day her family and she were talking in a group chat that they wanted to do something for Christmas that was coming up in a week so all her family wanted to pass Christmas at her house so she also agreed with that and she needed to clean and be ready for that Christmas but while she was preparing all that she was preparing the food, the Christmas tree, drinks, table and making sure that all the gifts were able to fit under and around the Christmas tree, so she was not so worried about her classes online, because she was able to do both things at the same time; preparing the Christmas stuffs and taking her classes online, and also she was very comfortable doing both things because it was not complicated for her and she toke it as the easy way.\n\nLast, learning from attending to classes by online is a good choice. Some students when they are taking their classes online they can also travel to different places. For example, when my cousin PROPER_NAME and me went to Myrtle Beach, I asked to my cousin Verenice why did she bring her computer to the beach and then she told me that she was going to need it because she was taking some classes by online, but I was wondering if she can take her classes while she was not at home, then I asked her and she told me that she was able to take her computer anywhere she was going and she can still take her classes online as normally, so that really surprised me because I did not know that students that take classes online could also have the chance to take their classes by being in different place, she was just relaxing the whole day and was enjoying every single moment without any interruption.\n\nIn Conclusion, I agree that students can attend to online classes because it can help them a lot and they can also save more time than going to normal classes. It is a good choice for students to learn and attend to classes from online or video conferencing, because students are able to spend more time with their family, they are able to other things while they are doing something else, and also students have the chance to travel to different places with having no problems with it.

{"essay": "Would you rather wake up early\u00a0every day just to go to school and feel grumpy every morning?\u00a0Or would you attend school at your house? The 2nd option sounds better right? But,is it really that nice? Going\u00a0school is more than learning about old people fighting,numbers,reading,and writing essays. Its about making friends and connecting with teachers and be more responsible. Also one importent thing about school is that its free. Online classes are expencive,hard to get used to,and impossible to work at home. This is why attending online school wont be worth it.\n\nFirst of all,.online classes can go up to 150 to 200 dollars. So, some students cant afford the classes. If you\u00a0want to get online classes, you must get a job and work for weeks just to pay for online classes. When you can just go to school for free. Also if you do get a job it will affect your work at school and it will affect your job. So. is it worth it?\n\nSecend of all, students can not\u00a0focus when they are at home. Cant work on your homework because your little brother is crying nonstop? Just imagine doing an online class for 90 minutes at home. Also, home is a place to rest,have free time,and spend time with family and friends. Home is not a place for school.\n\nLastly,online classes can be hard to get used to. You have been in a class room this hole\u00a0time in school. Now you have to get used to something new. Change can be hard on students. But,now they are all by themself in there house learning how to get through this online class. Where theres no one to help you but you. I am taking an online class in my last year of high school. Its hard. Its really hard. You wont understand what to do and what not to do. Because there is nobody showing me how to do it. Its just a 3 minutes video and now i have to wright a 3 page\u00a0essay. And not knowing what kind an essay to wright. Sometimes there are no videos to help you.\n\nSome people say that online classes are better then regular school. Well they are worng. Heres why,school can help you get your commnicaion\u00a0skills up and help you grow as a person. Teachers at school can help you to get through the class. In online class you dont know if you are doing something right or worng. There is no one to giude you but yourself. It is not better then regular school when you think about it. Online classes you are so limited you dont understand. At school you will have some many more opitions for you.\n\nin conclusion waking up at 6 oclock is going to be worth it at the end. If you attend online school the only person is going to help you is you.

{"essay": "In my opinion I would say that if students attend classes from home the student won't take that advantage of learning; For example if the student take a math class online it would affect them by not learning and doing others things at home that it won't let you focus. Taking online classes can also affect you because you can easily find the answers online. Which that leaves out that you pass and take that credit, but you really didn't learn anything.\n\nI know that if students attend classes from home they won't even try. Students will just give up and find the answers online that way they can just finish. Another thing is that they can say I will take it later and forget it to do it. And keeps saying that they will do it but forget every single time and thats when its start getting bad results,late and not pass and learn. Some student they work or they have others things to do,so they will just try to take the classes fast and rush and not learn. Students that take online at home it can be a problem because you won't able to concentrate\u00a0and focus on what you are learning if their is noises at home or if you little sister or brother they won't let you focus. Online you have no one to help you accept only if you cheat which that causes bad situation.\n\nI have many reasons why student should attend classes in school. My first reason is that students learn more the way the teacher teaches because the teacher can explain you a lot times as you want and explains as many ways you want until you get it and understand. In online their is only one example or one directions that shows you of how to do it and explains you, But thats can be a problem because some student will want to know for more direction and to explain well or other wise they won't do anything. However its better to attend classes in school. My second reason is that teacher gives you homework or projects to get more practice and be ready for test or quiz, that way you learn something. Lastly if you attend all your classes in school and you have homework or projects you can work with others student and get more ideas together get to know real people and talk.\n\nAs how was saying it better to attend all classes in school because you learn more many ways and get to know more people to talk. Students will take it serious and be really focus. I really think that students should just go to school and not take any classes online so they can be successful.   \u00a0", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}

{"essay": "Are you one of the students that is home schooled? If not, here are some of the benefits, why\u00a0some students choose to attend\u00a0classes in their home, by the way of online or video conferencing.\n\nSome people believe students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, however, home school is a great way of student to attend classes because they can focus in their studies, it's more safer,\u00a0and they can avoid bad influence from others.\n\nAttending classes through online or video conferencing has a lot of benefits like what I mention from the first paragraph, that homeschooling can help students to focus in their studies. For some reasons, some students that go to school can't be focused on their studies/activities because they are distracted by some of their classmate that is very naught. For instance, there are some\u00a0people that born in this world that are very naught, like even you defy him/her they will not listen to you and then\u00a0sometimes,\u00a0some of the other students will raise their pride and just walkout from their class because they don't want to listen any objection from their action. Another reason for home schooling is that, it's more safer for them to study. For example in today's society, a lots of bad things happening in the world, like school shootings that cause a lot of innocent students to die, like what happened in Florida, a few months ago. One of the reason also of homeschooling is that, they can avoid bad influence from others. Like for example, some of the school are diverse ethnic, students characteristics are diverse also, like some of the other likes to go shopping mall, likes to strolling anywhere, likes to bully others, likes to fight, likes to not go home after school instead go to other houses that they don't really even that much know, and many more characteristics.\n\nAlthough students will have benefits of\u00a0attending classes from school, however, attending classes from home has much more benefits. Attending classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing\u00a0can really benefit to the students because one of the biggest benefits is that, they\u00a0are more safer to study in their\u00a0homes, they have a great time to focus in their\u00a0studies, and they can avoid bad influence from others.", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "asian"}
