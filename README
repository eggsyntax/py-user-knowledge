Series of experiments testing how well LLMs (mainly GPT-3.5) can predict 
demographics from text (mainly OKCupid profiles).

This is HORRIBLE CODE. This was my experiment with letting GPT-4 generate 
most of the individual functions, and then it's just patches on patches 
from there.

Perhaps I will rewrite it if I get time.

Caveat emptor.
