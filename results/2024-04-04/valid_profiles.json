city last year after i finished b-school. love the bay area, and probably call it home now.\ni somehow know what my ultimate dream job is but i still try to find the way to get there.  currently working for a management consulting firm in the city. i also founded my non-profit last summer - and have a full team running the organization since.\npursuing things that matter to me - regardless of how hard it could be. i am a strong believer in an old saying \"if you want something badly enough, you will get it\". i am also good at making others laugh - and a great listener to my friends when they need me, be it the lows or highs. not a perfect cook, but i am proud of my cooking when i set my mind to do so (you just have to convince me of a good reason)!\na great sense of humor and
