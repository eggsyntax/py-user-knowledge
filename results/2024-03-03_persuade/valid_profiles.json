[{"essay": "Although schools said students should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students are not learning enough, actually students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students have more time to sleep and the opportunity of more healthy food.\n\nSome schools said students should not attend to classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students are not learning enough. For example, a\u00a0teacher said students are more lazy and Generic_Name said students don't take classes seriously. In my opinion I think that taking classes at home will be a big problem because students don't do what they supposed to do and also some time students just look at Google to answer what the teacher told to them. Students are not working hard to get want they want, some just said i want to be this or that but they don't put effort in on.\n\nSchools believe that students who take classes at home by way of online or video conferencing are not learning enough. For example, people think students become more interested in other things because they are at home and they can do whatever they want. Generic_Name said that students don't do homework when they attend to an school ,they will not do it at home either. In my opinion all that this people are saying is true because students don't see that what they are doing now can affect they life in the future, because if they to have a diploma they will never have a good job. I think that those schools that want students to take classes at home are making students to be more lazy than they are.\n\nAlthough some schools said students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students need more time to sleep. A reason is that students need to rest they mind so students can be prepare for the next day of class. Another reason is that students need to sleep at least 9 hours because they always went to bed late. In my opinion students need to sleep well because it is good for our self to sleep the correct hours not too little and not too much.\n\nAt this time some schools offer a distance learning program that will let students attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students can eat more deathly food. A example is that the president said that all the students have the right to have a good nutrition. A doctor also said students need a good nutrition because having a good nutrition students can absorb all the learning process. In my opinion this is a good idea because student can have a better nutrition at they on home. Having a good nutrition will make students more strong and they will be able to do many things.\n\nIn my position i think students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students will never put interest in what the need to do. This idea will just cause problems because is a lie that students will be connected to computer to take the classes. It is not the same to take classes at home that at school because at school students can ask the teacher if they have a question and teacher do what ever she/he need to do to make sure students understand it. To give students the opportunity have classes at home is like give students the option to take classes or not. I believe that finishing schools is a great goal in life is like the firth step to more big stuffs.\n\nSome schools said students should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students are not learning enough. I think that is the best because is not good for the students to take classes at home. Those schools who believe students should not take classes at home is because they want the beast for all the students.", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "I think students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend clases from home because for\n\nSome students will be more hard to learn and it will be effect in communicacion skills.\n\nstudents wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home becuase for some students will be more hard\u00a0to learn.

times this thing not have a good ideas and some times people have problema or they intrevol whit police and the reason is for they dont go school for good education and your parents not give the good

group your work is more ease for you because you have other peoples and thye help you in thing a goods ideas and they can make a good work if you work only you need more time for doing you work and some times we can chese a good things and some times we need others opinions the other peoples.\n\nMy opinin in this statemnt is, i agree because some times the classes in oline make ease and is a good oportuinite for some students for graduateand they can have a job, because some studen live alone and they need pay some bills then when take a classes online they have time for work and your life is more confortable, but this oportunities some times have a problems because some people not have a the same beneficts and this people need other thins like others helps and i thing school need other things not onle classes online or classes in the home because they dont know how is the life te other peoples ans when school have a this thins like classes oline and classes in te home they need put estrited rulers for students they make a shure when students take a classes and they need have a god teachers and good ideas for students take a classes and not have preblems when they need graduate, because sometimes students have a problemes for graduate and that not is good.\n\nI have other opinion for the classes take in the home this classes not is for all students because some studen like your age is 12 in 15 they need take a classes in the school they dont need job because they can work for you age and this students they need go school for learning more specific thing and practice more in the class taht reason is because some times some guys not want to go school and they skip the classes and school if the school not have a good control for this and this stundents need more motivation and more enfoques in the life, this guys need classes in the home some times when parents is estricted they can change and they dont doing any more time bad chose.\n\nAll school have make a sure this oportunities is better for students for examples they know if students feeld good in home and the relation whit family is better some people when tehy have a problems they cant enfoques in you school and this is a problem when you need graduate if you take a classes in the school and you have this problems you can talk whit other people like teacher or your friends but if you have a this problems and you take rthe classes in the home you cant talk whit other people for solve your problems. that why i say you need go to school when you have the oportuinite because the

I think that all people ,deserve can have the opportunity that can still studied. all people should have\u00a0the same opportunity , It is also a good idea, because all people can get that clases and be better proffesionaly, and good citizens and help the world be the change that de world need it, because some people that are so itelligent do not have opportunity to get a good aducation even assist to high school and how i said before . I think that are the people is equal ,and deserve the same opportunities, that others have.\n\nSome people, can be so proud know that can retake school or begging . thats will be a big hope for the people that is not study but they want to.

I personally think it's a bad idea because you won't get that much help, do stuff individual, and won't be the same as attending school.\n\nIf students wants to attend classes from home. Well I recommend not to because you wont get any help from the teachers. yes, you can call and do a video conferencing but it just wont be the same. For example, there was this one time that i was sick for a week because of the flu. So I emailed my teacher what I miss and her respond is to look it up on teams. Like how am I suppose to know what to do. And she wasn't any help at all. That's why its a bad idea to not attend at school.\n\nAnother reasaon why I think it's a bad idea to attend classes from home is that we do stuff individual. At school we have the option to work in a group with people to do our work sometimes. For example, lets say that the teacher let you work in groups. And you're in a group of four. Well some of us dont have to do everything. That's we have to do a little to cooraporate with the group. Meaning you don't have to do the work by yourself. That's why it's a bad idea to stay at home and do work by yorself.\n\nThe last reason why I think it's a bad idea is beacuse it won't be the same as attending school. You could also stay in a club or do sports. School is the best way of learning new things and socialize with people. They also havve soccer games and dances that you can go to. Plus you can get some good food from the cafeteria. That's why they should attend school.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it's a bad idea to attend classes from home.

If students are able to attend to classes from home by way on online or video conferencing it is a good choice, because students can have more time to spend with your family, students are able to do other such of things while they are doing something, and also students can travel to different places.\n\nFirst, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some students when they have classes by online they save more time for them and for their family. For example, my sister PROPER_NAME was going to normal classes at school but she did not want to go to school anymore so she decided to attend to classes by online, when she was taking her classes by online she noticed that she had more time to spend with her family, because when she was going to school she never had the chance to spend time with her parents like she does now like; by going shopping, visiting other families, etc. now she can go with her parents and do fun stuffs. Sometimes she also have the chance to go to parties with her friends, but before going out somewhere she always needed to finish her work and take her classes.\n\nNext, some schools offer distance learning to attend to classes by way of online. Students are able to do other such of things while they are doing something. For example, my cousin PROPER_NAME is taking classes online because she needed to take care of her one kid at home, one day her family and she were talking in a group chat that they wanted to do something for Christmas that was coming up in a week so all her family wanted to pass Christmas at her house so she also agreed with that and she needed to clean and be ready for that Christmas but while she was preparing all that she was preparing the food, the Christmas tree, drinks, table and making sure that all the gifts were able to fit under and around the Christmas tree, so she was not so worried about her classes online, because she was able to do both things at the same time; preparing the Christmas stuffs and taking her classes online, and also she was very comfortable doing both things because it was not complicated for her and she toke it as the easy way.\n\nLast, learning from attending to classes by online is a good choice. Some students when they are taking their classes online they can also travel to different places. For example, when my cousin PROPER_NAME and me went to Myrtle Beach, I asked to my cousin Verenice why did she bring her computer to the beach and then she told me that she was going to need it because she was taking some classes by online, but I was wondering if she can take her classes while she was not at home, then I asked her and she told me that she was able to take her computer anywhere she was going and she can still take her classes online as normally, so that really surprised me because I did not know that students that take classes online could also have the chance to take their classes by being in different place, she was just relaxing the whole day and was enjoying every single moment without any interruption.\n\nIn Conclusion, I agree that students can attend to online classes because it can help them a lot and they can also save more time than going to normal classes. It is a good choice for students to learn and attend to classes from online or video conferencing, because students are able to spend more time with their family, they are able to other things while they are doing something else, and also students have the chance to travel to different places with having no problems with it.

Its about making friends and connecting with teachers and be more responsible. Also one importent thing about school is that its free. Online classes are expencive,hard to get used to,and impossible to work at home. This is why attending online school wont be worth it.\n\nFirst of all,.online classes can go up to 150 to 200 dollars. So, some students cant afford the classes. If you\u00a0want to get online classes, you must get a job and work for weeks just to pay for online classes. When you can just go to school for free.

Taking online classes can also affect you because you can easily find the answers online. Which that leaves out that you pass and take that credit, but you really didn't learn anything.\n\nI know that if students attend classes from home they won't even try. Students will just give up and find the answers online that way they can just finish. Another thing is that they can say I will take it later and forget it to do it. And keeps saying that they will do it but forget every single time and thats when its start getting bad results,late and not pass and learn. Some student they work or they have others things to do,so they will just try to take the classes fast and rush and not learn. Students that take online at home it can be a problem because you won't able to concentrate\u00a0and focus on what you are learning if their is noises at home or if you little sister or brother they won't let you focus. Online you have no one to help you accept only if you cheat which that causes bad situation.\n\nI have many reasons why student should attend classes in school. My first reason is that students learn more the way the teacher teaches because the teacher can explain you a lot times as you want and explains as many ways you want until you get it and understand. In online their is only one example or one directions that shows you of how to do it and explains you, But thats can be a problem because some student will want to know for more direction and to explain well or other wise they won't do anything. However its better to attend classes in school. My second reason is that teacher gives you homework or projects to get more practice and be ready for test or quiz, that way you learn something. Lastly if you attend all your classes in school and you have homework or projects you can work with others student and get more ideas together get to know real people and talk.\n\nAs how was saying it better to attend all classes in school because you learn more many ways and get to know more people to talk.

If not, here are some of the benefits, why\u00a0some students choose to attend\u00a0classes in their home, by the way of online or video conferencing.\n\nSome people believe students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, however, home school is a great way of student to attend classes because they can focus in their studies, it's more safer,\u00a0and they can avoid bad influence from others.\n\nAttending classes through online or video conferencing has a lot of benefits like what I mention from the first paragraph, that homeschooling can help students to focus in their studies. For some reasons, some students that go to school can't be focused on their studies/activities because they are distracted by some of their classmate that is very naught. For instance, there are some\u00a0people that born in this world that are very naught, like even you defy him/her they will not listen to you and then\u00a0sometimes,\u00a0some of the other students will raise their pride and just walkout from their class because they don't want to listen any objection from their action. Another reason for home schooling is that, it's more safer for them to study. For example in today's society, a lots of bad things happening in the world, like school shootings that cause a lot of innocent students to die, like what happened in Florida, a few months ago. One of the reason also of homeschooling is that, they can avoid bad influence from others. Like for example, some of the school are diverse ethnic, students characteristics are diverse also, like some of the other likes to go shopping mall, likes to strolling anywhere, likes to bully others, likes to fight, likes to not go home after school instead go to other houses that they don't really even that much know, and many more characteristics.\n\nAlthough students will have benefits of\u00a0attending classes from school, however, attending classes from home has much more benefits.

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Other believe distance learning as an option is not beneficial to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I believe distance learning is\u00a0not beneficial for school students because of classwork, homework, and sports.\n\nFirst of all,I believe distance learning is not beneficial for school students because classwork in schools is\u00a0good source of grades in school. The\u00a0best way to gain knowledge is to going\u00a0school and learning new stuff by your teachers .\u00a0When you go to school you do assignments and class activities with your classmates and you all\u00a0work in groups by helping each other. You meet your friends and teachers who help you in many situations. If you don't understand any topic in class you can go at raise or stay after school to discuss any\u00a0problem with them. An example: I went to the school I had a test on that day and I got less marks on that test so I asked my teacher that can I retake my test he said that come after school I am available so I went after school make up my test and got good grades. These are the opportunities so more I got when I go to school regularly. I took one online Maths class and seems hard for me because I had so much work for that class and that made me unconscious for certain days. Present\u00a0in classroom\u00a0is to helpful for most of students and for me.\n\nMoreover,I believe distance learning is not beneficial for schools students because homework in\u00a0school is a main source for your grades. If you are\u00a0going to school regularly you get homework with you and you can do that homework by the help of your teachers if you don't understand your homework. By being at home you will not be able to discuss your homework problem with your teachers and when you don't submit your homework your grades will start to reduce.\u00a0when you will do any test or quiz you will get less marks because of your homework practice. An example: My friend never turn his homework because he thinks homework grades are not important for getting good grades at the end of the year when he got his final marks he had B instead of A because of his not submitted homework.\n\nAdditionally, I believe distance learning is not beneficial for school students in sports\u00a0because when you take online class you won't be able to participate in any school sport activities. Because If don't do practice for sports you will be not selected in games such as football, Soccer, and Basketball.\n\nThe requirements for\u00a0sports is good stamina, strength, and game techniques. when you come to school all the requirements are fulfill by your school coach. He teaches you how make your stamina good, skills, and teach you best technique to win and selected in the sports team. An example: my friend he was doing a online class and he had a trial for his soccer team and he fail at that trial because he was not able to work\u00a0hard to improve\u00a0his skill and techniques by the reason of that online class, but now he is taking regular school and he qualify for soccer with the help of school coach.\n\nFinally, distance learning is not beneficial for schools students because of classwork, homework, and sports. Therefore, I believe that distance learning shouldn't follow in school because regular schools helps students to improve their classwork performance, homework performance, and to be good\u00a0in sports by making good physical.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0", "sex": "m", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "asian"}, {"essay": "I DO NOT think students would benefit from distance learning.\n\nDistance learning isnt for everyone , My personal opinion is that i wouldn't have or want distance learning because I am more of a person that loves to interact with people and having a personal 1 on 1 with my teachers for help.

There's students that are use to it and can do individual work on their own. Having individual working skills is hard, having to not need help, everyone needs help in their at least once. Everyone hits a milestone in their life where they fall and need help to get back up. But being able to stay home feels great starting a lesson when every you have time, waking up at any time, as much as that sounds nice and fun I wouldnt want distance learning, Because going to school and being able to talk to friends and teacher is nice and easier than taking an online class.\n\nGetting home school or taking an online class isn't easy. I wouldn't like to talk to a person on a computer or showing my work through a camera and not being able to correct it right after or show your teacher so they can correct it. It's the best staying home and taking classes online because to time limit to get up in the morning and you don't have to worry about needing to get to class early , I still haven't whether it's best to stay home or not. Having friend and teachers that can help is nice and fun and you can socialize a lot . Also staying home to do your work and relax sounds nice but it's still not the best. I rather come to school and socialize rather than staying home.

One reason, school offer that option because they\u00a0don't want to student waste time to attend to school and they believe that students would be benefit receiving classes from their home. However, students can have more time to sleep for those who work until midnight can be a benefit receiving those online classes, but to\u00a0those students that doesn't work it would not be a benefit even though it will be worth\u00a0because they just will waste their time on the phone all day and even in the night too because they wouldn't have to wake up early and get ready to attend to school.\n\nI extremely believe the opposite, students shouldn't attend to online classes or video conferencing because students will just waste their time at home and not taking the classes on their computers or others electronic devices. Otherwise, Some others students doesn't have the same benefits as the others have for example: some students doesn't have the sufficient money or the same opportunity as the others to buy an electronic device such as computer to receive the online classes, so\u00a0those students has to\u00a0attend to school and receive classes with the school personal, that's one reason why I extremely disagree with some schools option like the learning distance. Another reason, attending to school students learn more faster than being at home with a computer because when they are receiving the classes on the computer they will check their social media at the same time as they are taking classes. However, attending to school students can learn many new words from the school personal and leaning new words can be such a great benefit.\n\nIn conclusion, however some say that attend to the distance learning is better, but I extremely believe the opposite students shouldn't attend to the distance learning, because that wouldn't be a good benefit in their education, and in their knowledge students that take the distance learning they\u00a0wouldn't learn the same way or the much as they learn when they attend to school and the teachers teach.\n\nI disagree with the distance learning that some schools offer to students because the distance learning it wouldn't be a benefit for students who attend to the option distance learning it would be just worth it because they would not learn that much and probably they will not pay attention to what on the classes are teaching to them.

Because everybody has a way of learning some students adapt quick and others learn slowly,but taking this one on one course helps you adapt really quick because you are alone in a quite environment which is going to help you adapt really quick! Online classes also helps because some students have a hard time waking up early in the morning to school which causes you to be late everytime,being late can lead you to detention,saturday school and other things. But with this online course you can take it anytime during the day.

Some schools offer distance learning for students who live far away from school because some students do not have transport to go to school, students can decide the time they want to take the classes, and students do not need to go out of their homes in winter time.\n\nOne major reason about some schools offer distance learning for students who live far away from school is that some students do not have transport to go to school. Many people has that problem because they do not know how to drive. Other students do not drive because they do not have legal documents. Some students do not have money to buy their own car.

I know most kids want this and thinks its a good idea and that they can benefit from it but i think that kids like me wouldnt but if you have to physically come to school some of the days like if you have the class all week that they make a rule that if you dont come to class physically for 2-3 days then they would lock your online work and u would fail, and if the teacher disciplines you and actually cares if you pass because some teachers dont care if you pass or fail then i think its a good idea,but i feel like a lot\u00a0of kids struggle in school now a days including me because these 4 years of H.S was hard for me and I know people that struggled to and I know that me and other people i know would be distracted.

Nowadays schools are starting to use technology more and are letting students take more online classes. Some people believe\u00a0that students would not be able to attend classes from home because they would have no one one time with a teacher and they would not be able to make up work if they miss anything. Although some believe that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, it should be known that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.\n\nStudents can have academic benefits if they take online classes. Firstly, students would learn time management. for example, if an assignment is due at midnight they would have to make sure it gets done. This could help them keep steady grades because the assignments would be turned in on time. Secondly, students would learn responsibility. For example, if they had work due in two days they would make sure it gets done within the two days because they know that they are responsible for doing the work and turning it in. Students would do the work because they know that they are responsible for their grades and the work that is due. Finally, it could potentially make them harder workers. For example, if a student is doing an online course and they get stuck on something they would not be able to get the immediate help from a teacher like they would if they were in a regular classroom setting, they would have to work harder and think more because they have less help. This shows why students would work harder and by them doing that they could have good grades.\n\nStudents could also have health benefits from attending classes from home. Firstly, students would be less stressed. For example. if they were in a regular classroom setting and they had work due by the end of that class period they would be in a rush and start to stress because they are limited on a short amount of time. This shows how online classes could be less stressful because students would not feel as rushed to complete the work. Secondly, students could sleep in a little longer which would give them more energy while they do the online work. For example, say schools started at seven in the morning and students had to wake up at six in the morning to get ready for school, when they first arrive they go straight to sleep and miss out on instruction and work. This shows how being able to have online classes is beneficial to students. Lastly, they would be more calm while doing the work. For example, if a student is at home doing online classes away from others they would be more calm and focused. This shows hoe students can benefit from attending online classes.\n\nAlthough some believe that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes fro home, it should be known that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Some people believe that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they have no real instruction and it could be less productive.

The students can cheat in their work from class\u00a0and then they would not learn anything what the teacher teach to him and to the students, and the teacher would not be able every time to help them in their work because, is a lot of students who need a lot of help sometimes, and i think the teacher would be busy\u00a0with the other students. and the students would not assist to class because of that things.\n\nThe students need to learn about education and society because if they don have that in life after school\u00a0would be hard to improve because they don't know how people can be,or maybe they wont like how their teacher are teaching them because they have ones in the computer in online they dont really know the teacher or whos teaching them or if its correct how they are teaching them because if you dont understand\u00a0the teacher there is other teacher who can help you with it and solve your problems in school you have and like in my country you think school is your other house and the teacher are like you second mothers because they are teaching you like you parents teach to you\n\nOne time i was in a online class doing a video call and, the teacher wasn't\u00a0there sometimes when i need help in my work.

And you can learn much better with out them because the teacher has more time for you. the students when they don't go to the class room in school must of the times is because, they don't like how the teacher teach to them but thats a really big problem. Some teachers know you skip their class or others,\u00a0they don't want to explain you because the student is not there must of the times but\u00a0the students need to learn in life some times you don't choose your things, like know in school your counselor can help you whit it, change the student with another teacher but when they go to college they do\u00a0not have that option.\n\nI don't thing is a good idea to have the classes online\u00a0because when you go to school you learn about responsibility. And how you can improve in a good way how you are, how responsibility you need to be in life, have respect with other people, with your teacher and the other students. You can improve something you want to be after your done with school,\u00a0like if you are good with society, you can learn in school that you can be a person who likes to talk a lot and you can choose in your life to be a reporter and in school they're programs and classes you\u00a0can choose, so you can learn more about it.\n\nFor been in school you make your life, your own decisions\u00a0of what you want to be in a future.

Not having someone to explain and provide specific information can be difficult in our path of learning.\u00a0An\u00a0example from my experience could be when I was still living in Mexico and I had to recieve English classes at home, but the online resources weren't the best ones to learn from. However, when I moved to the U.S.,\u00a0I started going to a regular school and it was easier for me to get along with the English language because the teachers helped me having a better understanding of what it was about and how to overcome in a short period of time.\n\nAnother way that\u00a0attending to a shool can be benefitial is, getting to know new people. As it has been said, becoming a teeneger leads us to want to afford new things. Meeting other students is so helpful because our social enviroment is increasing and the chances to succeed are maximied. In my case, interacting with other students helped me create\u00a0a better social background and grow in a high standar community as well as having friend because friendships are essential in a teeneger life.\n\nAdditionally, being able to show leadership can help our selves as well as others. At a certain moment, most of the teenegers have to go to college and it is difficult to get accepted in because many of the colleges in the U.S. want students\u00a0that are capleble to maintain in a possition to represent them in their community. For example, from my school there are a lot of after school activities as well as clubs where we can share important information of what is going on in school and out of school. They also prepared us to know how to talk in front of others and without a doubt clarify why we are standing there. This is what most of the universities want to see from a reguar high school student that attends to a regular school.\n\nAs shown above, creating new opportinities to grow in our learning skills can be found in a school. Which it is a more possible way\u00a0to acomplish our goals, rather than being at home without a light of success. In fact, having the opportunity to stablish a stable learning growth it's\u00a0not something that can be dissmissed because attending to a school can be helpful in ways such as having a profesional teacher, meeting new people, and able to show leadership.

Many of the students that can't attend to school in the United States of America is because they work and this work can't give opportunity to attend to school. Sometimes they don't attend to school because is hard to work and wake up in the mornings to go to school. They also many times prefer to do school at home because they maybe have physical problems and they feel better if they did at home. Many students can't come to school but if they did at home this shows that they are planing to graduate even if they don't receive a good chance to learn more.\n\nStudents at home are not learning what they can learn in school. They are not very prepared if they did school at home because sometimes teachers give activities with friends and students can learn from that activities or presentations of projects that the whole class did it.

If you are learning English and you did school at home if they speak other language that is not English you can't practice it.

In recent years, students have been given the opportunity to attend classes from home. This availability has not only shown a great increase in student participation, but an increase in overall passing. I believe many high school students could benefit from distance learning because it is more convenient for those with obligations outside of school and the environment of a public school can be overwhelming at times; However, the actual efficiency of distance learning depends on each student's learning preference.\n\nEach year, technology advances further and provides access to much more convenient means of learning. Distance learning gives students the opportunity to not only learn outside of school, but also the chance to better balance their time. Many high school students are choosing to become employed and with access to attend classes from home, they can better schedule time between work and school. Others may have obligations to family or peers which leads to low attendance percentages; In an institution's perspective, higher rates of attendance means they are doing well. Allowing students to take online classes means those who can't physically be at school, can still complete their courses without damaging their school's, or their own, image. Attending classes from home also teaches students responsibility, accountability, and expands their learning abilities, each of which are skills that will be crucial to succeeding in future careers.\n\nFurthermore, public schools can be very overwhelming for many students. As a student with multiple anxieties myself, I perceive distance learning as a way to escape the unnecessary stresses that come with attending a public school. Having the opportunity to complete courses online, from home, means there is no need to feel obligated to look or act in any particular way. Students would not feel so pressured to meet the high expectations some teachers reflect, and could work at their own pace. In addition, it has been found that students who teach themselves, whether it be online or out of a textbook, are much more flexible when it comes to finding a career; Flexibility is an important characteristic because many employers look for someone reliable who can multitask. With each of these things in mind, distance learning might sound ideal for everyone.\n\nHowever, not all students prefer, nor are capable of, distance learning. All people have different learning preferences, and some would rather sit in a physical classroom simply because they learn better that way. Though many students find this method endearing, some are not yet capable of the responsibility that needs to be taken in order to complete courses from home. Although this way of learning can benefit many students, it should not become the sole way of teaching because it is not inclusive to all.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the statement that students would benefit from being able to take classes from home; However, I do not think this is an ideal method for all students.", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "white"}, {"essay": "What would be the best way for students to continue learning over the break teacher-designed or student-designed projects?

He gave me a five page packet over my summer break. It was about some lessons I really didn't understand in his class. It really helped me out the next year i was the top kid in class because of the packet he designed for me.\n\nHowever that might be the case but,If the projects were student-designed they could design a project that is about their weak points to work on them..Also,if the students create the projects it showed how creative they are and how much they care about their education. They will also get the opportunity to create projects they'll enjoy doing and still get a good lesson from it. For example,Generic_Name designed his project on his game system now, he get to play the game and do his work at the same time. Although,some students might be too busy or not even take the time to design one.

But if one student is studding online or at home they are listening for when they have to take the exams they can pass and are more responsible with that.\n\nWhen the school is over at the end of the year some people learn a lot but some people no because they were just playing and don't putting attention or sleeping in class.

Is benefit to them to take the classes from their home, the students can relax more and do their work on time. For example, I would like to take my classes from my home because I work and sometimes I do not had time to finish my homework and all my assignment from my others classes. Others benefits for take classes from your home is you can have more time with your family because some family they work at night and you can't see them.

Students should not only be provided with a sheet that gives prompt ideas and lists what does meet project guidelines as well as a list of things that will result in a loss of points on the project. There are many things a student can come up with such as a photography journal with a paragraph beside each photograph explaining the significance of the Photo , or someone who loves astronomy completing a model solar system with why each planet is suitable or not suitable for life.

Also,\u00a0a lot of students do not benefit from an online class because they do not give all their effort to learn. They focused more on what is happening in their surroundings, and even they can fell sleep. Sometimes is really hard to focus when there are things going on surround us but it only takes a lilttle of effort.\n\nStudents that actually benefit from an online class is because they are interested on passing that class, and want to learn as more as possible; putting\u00a0all the effort, focus, and heart on it.\n\nAs a conclusion, students that attemt to classes from home by a way of online or video coferencing can benefit from it and most can't. It takes a lot of effort and focus to learn from an online class, and that is a something most students do not have.\u00a0", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "Student would be a benefit if they are to able to take online you need to aproud by your self because not going late in the class be on the time and more careful if you are en 12 grade you have less time for wait oportunities from a graduate, another example ;if your are new in the schools you need to pay attention be on the time and not missing a class.\n\nbecause some people make a lot a problem is why they teacher want a better things for you personalities is one reason the only you need to aproud for doing excelent person in this life but if you lose the oportunities not doing something bad you need to take position for you attendes you need to be a good person you need to try if you no try something never doing nothing be confident at you self on the schools a student , have benefit because attendent in the schhols, is important from when do not have a better opotunities\u00a0and a big idea to learned more no wait a time from ,you personalities and you future to . is why some student have a lot problem when they wan't a job or doing something whit benefit some people wan't a benefit is a good record because when you missing one day and nex day you doing lost because is the simple reason a you was missing in the class do no't have idea what do you toking about ,you comming to the schools you coming a lost because you don't have idea they another student doing is why. another reson is attend is important becuase a make good boy or girl is the more things in this life are good person.", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "In the life today, education is important for people, and an options of choosing school or places to learn are also make people thinking. From what I heard on the news, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But, is it truly helpful for student? or it is just the way to comfort student, so they can stay home and do whatever you want to do without the administer from the teacher.\n\nFirst, when we talking about schools, we are also talking about our future, this is really important more than anything. If we\u00a0come to school everyday we\u00a0will get a punch of information and ideas for our self, we could meet other people, contact with them and make friends. In that way, you will never feel stressful or stuck instead of staying home and do your own work.\n\nSecond, even though school are welcome you to come, but somehow the weather, the distance or something about personal that make you not able to come to schools, and the better options for you that are stay at home and learning from online or conferencing. For me, if I have a chance to choose between two options, I will choose to be in class, not attend classes from home, even though something will clog me, I will still want to come to schools. For example, if I spend in schools I could know a lot of things than I stay and take classes at home, I will meet my friends and my teacher everyday, we will discus about stuff at school, joining some club to reduce stressful after schools. And if you decide to take classes online, it is not bad, but for me it is not helpful. You better to go to school, you have to contact with other people, having conversation and discus with each other. You have the right to choose your own options. But be active, don't be passive.\n\nThird, dispose your time is the best way to live. If you can walk, you able to go to schools, so the option attend classes at home is not for you to choose, it is not benefit for you, I am just agree with the people who not able to move or stuck of something about personal to take classes at home, in that way, they can get information and study like other people. So I think that is fair for everyone, don't just give student an option like that and it will turning them to be lazy, busy working or don't have enough time in schools. If necessary, student can take online after schools to complete anything they miss.\n\nFinally, I think we should put the option about the classes online for only the people who are not able to go any where, not for normal people. In that way we can balance between these two, and every student can study in the better way.\n\nIn conclusion, benefit or not benefit are depend on you, for me the option to take classes at home\u00a0is not benefit, because I always want to come to schools everyday to get experience for myself, to get new things and meet new people. And you should go that way like me, we young and we hold our future in our hand, don't just stay passive.\u00a0", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "asian"}, {"essay": "I agree\u00a0that students would benefit better on taking online classes and video conferencing at home.

Society now in days has many bullies in school that it comes to the point that studuents don't want to come to school and prefer taking class at home by there self.\n\nFor example I had a cousin that took online class at home because he had no transportation to get to school. He was able to benefit better at home because even when he was sick he would still be able to accomplish his work. Most of the teenagers want to go to school but they can't because they have no way to get to school.

My cousin got education and he graduated and he only\u00a0took online classes and it helped him a lot due to not having tansportation to school.\n\nThere are many kids out in the world thet get bullied in school and they want a education but they can't due to bullys. Classes at home can benefit kids getting bullied in many ways for example, you won't have to worry about getting bullied at home if you take classes at home, you will get less distraction, and you will work in your own level taking classes at home.\n\nTherefore, This is why I agree that students can benefit better taking classes at home in many ways.

Some people think that students would not learn as good as they want them to learn by taking classes at\u00a0home online. They feel that the teachers have to be teaching, explaining, and responding questions person-to-person to understand even faster. I believe that students would actually focus even more by taking classes at\u00a0home\u00a0because most of the them\u00a0have jobs, expensives, and family to support.\n\nOne reason why attending classes from home online is it important is because students have another life besides school. Students would barely spend time at home. Students have to make their own choices, their own things, and their\u00a0own path in order to have a successfully future. The majority of the students work a bunch of hours and get off from work very late. They would not like to wake up early to go to school the next day.\n\nAnother reason why is because students need to pay their expensives. They have the necessity to buy things as well, to pay their bills, food, and rent. Students would neither be able to achieve their goals, nor have a pacefull life without any struggle if they don't pay their expensives. In order to have a life out of debts, they must work for their\u00a0necessities.\n\nThe final reason why is because some students have their families back in their countries. They support them and they also give them an economic aid. The more money they make, the better it is because not only their\u00a0parents help them, but them.\u00a0We are\u00a0a diversity of students and each one of us have different reasons, purposes, and persuits.\n\nAs you read, everyone think differently and have different\u00a0reasons.

There are many benefit and reasons\u00a0they prefer online classes. Firstly distraction in classroom, students use to distract with others friends in class while the teacher is talking. Secondly\u00a0the transportation is very important because a lot of students live far away from school. Finally taking online classes students get the same credit as taking the class inside the school.\n\nIn many schools, students have the option to choose online classes or classes in school. Firstly the benefit of taking online classes is students are able to do their work without distraction of their friends. For example, when the teacher is explaning the concept in the classroom some students like to talk and disctract others in classroom. However in online classes is\u00a0only the teacher and there are not students distracting others in the class. Secondly students can ask any question about the concept of the class to the teacher. For example in class there is always something that students don't understand really well.\n\nDuring the last decade\u00a0students have been distractived with many king of technology\u00a0like cellphones and video games on computer. But\u00a0some schools also are taking advantage of this technology by offering online classes and creating opportinies to learn from home. Students can watch videos about explanation of classes on their phones. Basically this opportunity is helping many students give them knowledge and preparing them to the future.\n\nThe most important thing about online classes is that students get their credit as they were taking the regular class. Last year I had two option to choose, the first option was go to an academy to learn about marketing. The second option was take the online course from the academy. So\u00a0this opportunity is great for everyone because students can improve their knowledge with online course and we still get the regular credit as we take the class in the academy.\n\nAnother benefit is in video conferencing the students can go back anytime they need in the video. In the other hand the students do not worry about transportation. Since many students arrive late to school they are not there when the teacher is giving\u00a0the explanation to the class. Because the bus\u00a0arrive late to school.\u00a0In rural areas the schools are far away from the studen's home. So taking online classes they don't worry about it. Because all they need to do is log in\u00a0their computer and to the class.\n\nIn conclusion, online classes is a great option to students. Studesnts get the same credit as taking the class in the school. Also there is not transportation to worry or the trafic to arrive late to school. Lastly\u00a0there is not distraction in online class. Also the online class count as the regular class of the school.

That might a good idea for some students but not all. Today, many High Schoolers from the age of\u00a015 to 18 have jobs. They work part time to help their parents pay for their phone bills, cars or something else. Sometimes they might want to work more, but school is 5 days a week, they have to do homework every night even on weekends. Going to work after school is very overwhelming. They get out at 9 or 10 depends on where they work, go home and do their homework, then go to bed probably late, and have to get up early the next morning. That goes on days after days. Many students can get stressed out easily. So I think attending classes online or video conferencing help lots of students who have jobs. Staying at home and study is still better than waking up and getting ready\u00a0early in the morning to go to school. That might not be a big problem in summer or spring. But winter is the worst time of the year for students. The sun rises later than usually and sets earlier. It gets really cold and there is frozen ice on streets. Nobody wants to get up early and go to school or work when the sun hasn't even risen and frezzing weather outside. Of course they want to wrap around in their blankets and sleep in. But in the other hand, attending to school directly is better for some students. Leaning and teaching face to face is always easier than online. You could ask the teachers directly if you don't understand, and I think the teachers would be teaching and explaining in a better way face to face. Plus, you can meet new friends, socialize and participate in sports or any activities at school. So in the bottom line. I think it's better to combine both ways. The students can attend school everyday, except for snow days. They can take classes online since they can't make it to school. Cut the students some slack on some Fridays. They can stay home and attend classes online. Or only apply on seniors. Because it's their last year and they have lots of work to do. But in my opinion.

I think that students will benefit more from distance learning than from going to school. Not everyone agrees that going school is for them. Distance learning is gives a better chance to learn all your education.\n\nHere are a couple reasons why I support the idea of distance learning.\n\nFirst, reason why I think that distance learning is more beneficial to you is because you can manage your time better with class\u00a0work and classes. You have the opportunity to work on your own schedule. Separate the classes throughout the day instead of all bunched up at once. More time for you to focus on either classes you kind of struggle with or classes most important. All work does not have to have a due date or time limit. You can take your time to understand the material at hand and do all your work when capable.\n\nSecondly, the more comfortable the environment the better you work. Schools environment isn't so good for\u00a0students, sometimes we sit in classes where its hard to learn. Hard to learn because a lot of kids\u00a0do not take there work serious, stay off task, and distract others from learning. That harms the learning environment makes kids get a little frustrated at times with there work. Its not easy to do your work while not being able to concentrate correctly and being distracted. When you are in a comfortable environment, work is not so complicated. You can relax, think straight,\u00a0and focus on the task at hand with no problems. Being able to attend class from home keeps you away from the bad environment.\n\nLast but not least, the safety of the students is always important. While in school kids can be harmed in different type of ways. Some get bullied others get into altercations. This is hard to stay away from because you are in school and it surrounds you. This can definitely throw off a student and get them off track. When kids start to think about many other problems instead of there school work it is not good. Attending your classes at home, online, or through video conference is the safest way to attend. You wouldnt have to worry about the school drama or the bullies. Your mind will be strictly focused on the work you have to do and nothing less.\n\nIn conclusion, the idea of students attending classes from home, video conference, or online. Is most beneficial because of there safety, work environment, and schedule. I agree with my reasoning and support them to the max because distance learning is the best way to learn. Your student should give distance learning a chance its worth it.\u00a0", "sex": "m", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "I think that\u00a0is good opportunity for\u00a0student because some student to need work and do not have time for came to school in the morning, if taking the classes from home have more time for do another things,sometime when we came to school but some student interrupt the class i think can to concentrate in home but too i think is more easy to copy some answer from google,from\u00a0another people or something like this but i not sure how is taking clases online or video conferencing.\n\nThe student who have the classes online or video conferencing is because only have one or two classes to graduate, but neither all schools has this opportunity only high schools. but neither all high chools.

People may say that going to school is much easier because you can get help from many students around you\u00a0with what your working on and everything that you'll learn will be read and given an in example for you from your teacher; however, I believe that if you do take online classes it will do the same as if you went to school because it will be the same material and it will be a less of a hassel waking up every morning to go to school.\n\nLearning the same material while your home\u00a0is a great thing because you dont need to go to school to learn it while you are home.

But I don't think that it would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because, there are many\u00a0reasons that the students\u00a0could not able to learn home by yourself in online; which are that some problems, and communicating. Also there are more position to I disagree and agree with this argument.\n\nFirstable, I think the students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, it would not benefit for the studehts, because of the students could have some question that they don't know. And if someone who dont' teach with them, they cannot learn that more understable. And they migth cannot catch up their late works, because of they don't help anybody. I have an examples of that the girl who has taken an online classes, and she didn't go to the school, because she thought, the online class is better than to learn subjects and it\u00a0doesn't have to do that everyday and she can study her subject whenever day she could. But she have to her exam in the school, and she didn't study as well as can't catch up her study work. Now she stopped to take an online class in the home and go to school. So, in my opinion, even thought the online class is giving you as more free time but if you can't study by yourself, It couldn't help you that learn.\n\nAlso, the students can't communicate with other students. It means that the student can't study with\u00a0other students that they\u00a0can't make some friends and could not be an active just like some\u00a0other students. Also,\u00a0it will be\u00a0impact their behaviour that they'll be\u00a0more lonely. Because the\u00a0students behaivior is always changing and easy to get used to\u00a0their environment, especially the high school students. Therefore, i disagree to attend classes from home by way of the online\u00a0and video conferencing benefit for the students.\n\nOn the other hand,\u00a0the online class is not really useless thing that for the students. Of course, It should be has\u00a0some advantegious way to attend online and video class, which are it helps that the students could be\u00a0more mature and more focusing on their work. And they have more free time because the student doesn't have to this everyday as a school, they can do that whatever time to working on it. So, we don't have to hold\u00a0one\u00a0point of view, we should try that two other sides. For examples, the every students are different way to study, we don't have to demand to do only one way, they might be more interest with the online,\u00a0video class and the other students could be more enjoy to attend this class. Consequently, every students who enjoy that much, they could take that class much easily to study in their home.\n\nIn conclusion, I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, but not all of students, because they all have a different way to study and somehow the student will need some help to support their what they are studying. In that case, students might be trying to give up to study alone.

Let us going back in time to see how did get here. During revolutionary war in United State of American. Some british had education, but there was not school at the time. Being able to give education for\u00a0students it was home. And this was for colonies teaching them in group how they can introduce by themeselves and understand command they are given. Late in\u00a01800s to 1900s system changed by government of the time because it began to underatand how education was imporatant to the people. It began to build some classes, so people will not struggle for taking class at home or under the trees. The challenge was not is because the main points was money and people need to do this governement used one idea to increase tax for everything\u00a0in able to finish the plan. That is how\u00a0classes have been found. Time of technologies a rise was in middle of 1950s were people began to use new material like box computer and other stuff. Today we do have many choice as for school we may take classes onlline,\u00a0pay tutor at home, or taking classes at school. What i have discoved is when you are taking classes at school your diverse yourself better that at home, or online.\n\nYes i do think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because the challenge of studying\u00a0at school wil not be similarity to the challenge of taking classes at home. School does many things can reguard a students to stay focus. While, he or she is taking classes. Take a look some examples: First\u00a0your will be able to increase knowledge of communication all the time to anyone. Second\u00a0you will have a chance to create a beautiful profile even you never think that you will have it. What i meant is when you are student you are a mirrow to other especially in our community becase school contain many difference cultures. Third is you will have extra help than\u00a0home or online. The specific idea of attending classes is to learn new things you never knew before. You know the way you may understood in front of the teacher it will not same the way you are watching video or reading online. Another thing you may see is some student the have many activities they attend like physical education, musical instruments, and some they are in clubs. Which meenas you have benefit everywhere. Moreover, taking clesses at school is still better options because the environment by itself is enjoyable. Making friends that you can have fun with, or they could help you when you are in diffuclt stuation. they are\u00a0many things you will benefit from. As you taking classes at school.\n\nSome people may argue that is not fair whether you taking classes at school,home,or online you still have same education and academies in excellectual way. Because you do have a schedule. They do have schedule. Your taking different subjects. They do taking different subjects. You do have many different options and other they do. And they think that the way student whose taking classes at home or online may have same view to the student whose taking classes at school. One of the highest point of this people who supporting the students are taking classes at home is. The student will have enough time to do many work than students who are taking classes at school because. You may choose to work other things and return to do your activity for school. And you may choose different options that none has choosed, but that how they think i do not. Meanwhile, the idea of this part is very complicated because the way this people think about this is very consiousness. you may ask me how but the answer is. The way students who are taking classes at school it will never become similar to the students who arevtaking classes at home.\n\nYou know that descreptions of many empires became emphisizable because the way peolpe attended to school the time brought many idea than the student who used to do their own without having many different thought. Based on me it seems to understand idea of how people argue that the milk may test like water really!\u00a0Another thing is to review the important stuation of student who are taking\u00a0classes at school. Given point to this topic is to analyzing the main result from students who are taking classes at home and the ones are taking classes at school. Because the students classes at school always seems right than other. The way student behave, the way student handle task, and how much effort that he is using. But at home student may cheat not body knows, whether he complited task or not. No one have to care. That the bid different you may see. Because is said the meaangless of student who work by himself he will never feel couragoues like other it is hard. Even to trust what he is doing sometimes nor always.\n\nON my cocnlusion i will adrress the creason that igiven on seoncd paragraph and i will adreress the description of difference i have given on paragraph four.

Two i have given the description on paragraph four of how student who are taking classes at home, and student who are taking classes at school is not same classes at home have few benefit. Because the situation it may not be serious and this paragraph it is kind reason that i have given, but not necessary.

Is there any benefit to know is this option is going to help the student phsychlogy, mentally or physically?. Education is too important! And a better way of learning is by attending to SCHOOL! The way as many people done it. Also, by this way attending to school students might join in sports, activities, etc. It gives more benefits and helps to refresh your mind. School gives classes of \"PE\" which is important because doing sports is healthy.\n\nIn 2015, a student at Generic_School took the option to attend classes by online because the student was not a \"social\" person which means the student did not like to communicate. But after all the student did regret it. The student noticed that communication is too important because is part of education and how to success in life. The words of the student to advice the students were \" There is no more benefits than attending to school. School does help you to your knowdlegde and prepare you for your future. Did not like the fact of waking up too early and to deal with all those people every single day, but here is the thing as people we cannot avoid people. It does affect you plus It does not make sense at all. Why? because WE ARE THE PEOPLE. What I learned by taking this option and what made me regret it was : We are the community, we are the voice of the world and as a group working together we can make big changes and a better society as well. And classes from home by the way online or video conferencing, this does not give you \"P.E\" classes and doing sports is wealthy. So by now attending to school is the best option for everyone.\" The student had excellent grades, scholarships, made new friends than he expected to have. Where is he now by making the best option? He is now at SCHOOL_NAME preparing for his major as a lawyer. He became an example for many students that have the same issues as he had.\n\nAs an immigrant this is a real big request, they must attend classes by going to school. It is too important because the lack of language and credits are needed. United States is an immigrant country and their schools has these excellents programs called \"Esol\". Of course, immigrants need these kind of help. They need to get involved by attenting to school. Why? Many immigrants come to this country to have a better future, they absolute have different customs, a different kind of thoughts, etc. So that infers a lot more than you think...Especially, each country have a different system's programs for graduation like in South America you only need to pass all of your classes for graduation, but how many classes are they? More than 17 classes. In United States you need to pass all of your classes plus the SOLS. This is the reason why immigrants must attent to school, It does help you to refresh your mind, to have new thoughts, new experiences, and to know what you need for graduation. Its is hard because Immigrants needs an esol teacher and to not attend to normal classes for awhile as long as you learn the language.That is why it takes a little longer for them to graduate and that is why they do need to attent to school. To understand much better the topics of each SOL class because they do need credits as any student. Otherwise if they choose the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is not going to help them as much as the school will.\n\nIn conclusion, a better learning is by attending classes from school because school give you more opportunites, more methods of learning, to socialized, to communicate. It inpires you to keep going and to have an idea of what you want your future to be like. Which means it prepares you for life. Any issue that you have they will help you to work on it, to find a solution. Like this student did not like to communicate at all, but he noticed that attending to school is the best option because it gives you the ideas of what you want to do, the opportunity to meet the college you want to go. To know what you can do to improve yourself! Also, It helps immigrants to learn the language with this program to pass your SOL classes to graduate, they receive a double help from school.

Students complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break that the school required. Summer projects is like a homework that is given to students during their break. Summer break is a two months break from school it is also the longest break that a student have. School is a place where a student can learn new things in order to get a diploma to have a job in the future. Schools shouldn't require students to complete summer projects during their break because students will be more lazy to go to school, no one will do it, and students will forget everything.\n\nCertainly, some people believe that schools should require students to complete summer projects because they don't do anything during their break. During summer break some students only play video games and sleep. Others may think that students needs to be prepared for the next school year. So that the students will be more advance and the topics that they're gonna learn wouldn't be hard for them. Still others may think that students needs to learn more new things during their break. These people are wrong.\n\nSchools shouldn't require students to complete summer project; students will be more lazy to go to school. Teenagers are already tired of school if school board made them do some summer projects they're giving them a reason why students doesn't like going to school. Do students like to go to school nor do students like to do homework. Homework is one of the main reason why students doesn't like going to school. Teachers make a hard homework. Giving students a project during summer break is too much work for them because they already done a lot of work during their school year. People need a break from everything. Youngsters don't have time for summer projects because they are working during summer break to save money for college. Summer break is the only time they can work for a long hours to save money and to help their family to pay their bills. Working for the long hours during school year will be hard for a students especially if they doesn't know how to multitask. Sometimes too much is bad for people's health; they can harm to a person emotionally and mentally. Emotionally because they will have no time for their families; mentally because they didn't have a chance to have a brain break that can lead them to depression.\n\nSchool Board shouldn't require students to do a summer project because no one will do it. Students are busy during summer break. Some students spend time with their family because they don't have time during their school year. During school year students are really busy especially those who are in colleges; summer break is the only time they can go home to their families. When students go home to their family most of them go on vacations. Vacation is what all people need to avoid depression from school. If schools give students a projects during their summer break, then students will not enjoy their vacation. Teenagers will feel more frustrated. Students got no time for their selves to relax and enjoy the peaceful environment unlike the school. The environment at school are really depressing and stressful. If school required students to do projects at home they will feel the exact same thing how they feel about school. People needs a break from school and everyone needs a rest.\n\nSchool shouldn't require students to do a project during their summer breaks because they will just forget everything they done. Students can finish their project for only just a week. People just want to finish their work without learning it. Finishing work without learning it doesn't make any sense because schools give students or teachers summer projects to get ready for the next school year. Students doesn't even used what they learned they just do it for the grade. Summer break is a very long break for a students if school give students a work to do they will just forget what they've learned. People do a lot of things during summer break.

It's just not a good idea, it's realy not that hard to attend school get through the days and come home and do wha you normally do on your daily basis.

Student can say, yes take classes online at home can be cool, but what happened when they have to take a SOL? They do not what they have to do because they don't practice with a teacher no one tech them to pass their classes and SOL. If we have schools is because students have to be there on schools. Take classes at home is not a better idea to me because we have to wake up, come to school take all our classes, learn new things at school because is there where that teachers are to be ours heroes and helps us to be someone someday on the life. Not everybody like that idea because they thinks like me, how a English online class can help us? if sometimes we don't know what we are doing on school can be more hard at home with a computer that can talk with you face to face only give you instructions and that's it.\n\nBody paragraph:\n\nTake classes online at home which can be the benefit for us? nothing because is not the same thing, last year I'll take English 11 online and that not help me because I can't understand because everything was different in there nobody told me how I can do my work, or no one show me examples, nobody talked to me face to face and then I failed my English 11 class because I never understand that because was difficult and very different to school. I prefer wake up early Monday to Friday at 6:00 A.M. and come to school because is better cause I know I can learn something new and interesting and teacher can teach me and show me how to do my works in class and that's a benefit because your learn easily and you have all your friends close to you, and you know you can be someone someday because now you learn how studies work. it's a little hard sometimes but if you want to be someone important in the life you have to work so hard on the school and be prepared. Take online classes for some students can be easily way to pass their classes and maybe they right, because you don't have to present projects, or resolve problems of math, or sometimes discuss with your teachers because you don't want to do your work that's a easily way to pass our classes, but that not help like a teacher in class because a computer or tablet don't talk to you and explain how you have to do your work and computer just give you instructions and that's it and what happens if you don't understand the instructions? you do not do your work because you don't know how to do it, while a teacher can explain you the whole class if you don't understand cause that's their work help students, so I think online classes is a bad idea because that help students to be more lazy. and they don't want to attend school.\n\nConclusion:\n\nMany people think If they want to created a program for students to take classes online it can be work, but it can be different too because that things which have low price can be more costly than a high price. I only wants to say is online classes can help students to take other classes which they need and take one at home, but what happens if someday in a university he or she don't understand what the teacher is talking about, because they take that class on a computer and nobody explains to them how to do that work.

Parents would disagree with the thought of having their kids staying home and learning but I believe that students should have\u00a0distance learning as an option and let me tell you why. Every student learns at a different pace, students often debate on showing up or staying home from school, and not all students require the same classes.\n\nFirst reason why i believe distance learning is beneficial and should be offer at schools is because not every student learns at the same pace. Some students would require a little more time on an assignment as the\u00a0others would not. I grew\u00a0up in a community\u00a0where teachers didn't\u00a0ask if you'd understood the lesson, or if you needed help, they would just keeping moving forward, which had a huge negative impact in my grades. Having one on one lessons with teachers and getting the proper education without actually being there, but through a computer screen on the other side of the state\u00a0is a game changing experience\u00a0that students would love and should be willing to choose from.\n\nSecond reason why i think online or video conferencing is beneficial\u00a0to students is because like most students, they wake up exhausted\u00a0in the morning, and debate whether they want to go to school or stay home. Missing a whole day of school instead of starting at the time you want could really hold you back from\u00a0getting your education. I\u00a0have a friend who chooses to stay home instead of coming to school because he feels like once he gets to school\u00a0no one helps him, but when he would take his classes online he would have all of his work done and still have time to start on the next lesson. Online classes are very beneficial to students who find school difficult.\n\nThird reason to why i believe students should\u00a0require online learning as a benefit is because not every student can get the subject or class required for graduating at their school. Many students shouldn't require taking all the basic classes if its not necessary, if a student is focusing on becoming an architect\u00a0they should mainly take classes for that instead of classes to become something else. Online classes also give students time\u00a0to reflect and explore more learning options.\n\nAs you have read i believe, that students should get the opportunity of getting online or video conferencing\u00a0as it does help students to focus, get their work done, and farther their education.\u00a0", "sex": "m", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "Schools that provides distance learning as an option to attend classes from home online, or video conferencing are few of all the country. It is a good idea for all students that wants to graduate, even if they don't\u00a0have time to go\u00a0to school every day.\n\nStudents some times don't have\u00a0time to go to school every day, some of them works in a part time jobs; That's difficult to them because, they need to wake up earlier to go to school and do homework in the afternoon.\n\nSome students decided not go to school any more because, they need to work to pay bills, and\u00a0help their families in home. Also, with this option students can be relaxing in their homes and studying at the same time. Another example why this is a good option for students is because some of them need\u00a0classes to\u00a0graduate, and they can not\u00a0get that classes done\u00a0by the school year, but if they have the possibility to take classes online they can finish during the year.\n\nHowever, this beneficial option is good for those students that are not eligible anymore to attend school\u00a0because of their ages. There is a final\u00a0age that students can be accepted by the school, and if they had more than the age the school said, they can not attend to school anymore, even if they want to continue going to school and graduate.\u00a0That's\u00a0why online classes from home is great idea for those students who wants the diplomat.\n\nIn conclusion this option is beneficial for all students that want to study and do other jobs in the same time. Those who work\u00a0and wants to finish school, are benefit with this amazing idea that some schools provide. The're just few schools that students can assist for those who want to get their diplomas done with facility way to study.

Although some people think student should not take online clasess, neverthless, there is some people who agrees with that situation in education. Because, the online clasess are time limit so they can use their time wisely in other things and student who\u00a0have to face transportation problem every morning, clasess from home will make their life more easier.\n\nTo bging taking online clasess from home is much more valuable because those clasess are\u00a0time limited, so that student can use their other time wisely. For example, usually online clasess have seseaons which is fixed time. One course must have to be done by\u00a0that seseaon time. In that case student can plan their study in a day and do a job in their free time. In USA most of the student have to take loan to finish thier education. So doing a job while taking an online course will help a lot with those\u00a0loan terms. Clearly, it is binificial to take online clasess and agree with the offer of distance learning.\n\nFarthermore, student who do not have own transportation, online clasess are the best option for them. For instance, in USA it is a big problem for people who do not have own transportation. Most of the time its the student who suffers most. Every single morning they have to rush for public transportation to go to the campus so that they will not get late for class. Some time it effects thier attendence, depends on institute and thier professors. This proves that taking an online class solve most of those problems easily. And student will be able to focuse on study more than handeling little problems like those, which is alomost turning into a part of their daily life.\n\nOverall, it is much more imprtent that taking a class online saves time and let student do other jobs to earn enough and a oportunity for them to be on time when there is a possiblity of being late to the class only because of transportation problem. This shows that student should attend clasess from home by way of online or vedio conferencing and accept the offer of distance learning.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "asian"}, {"essay": "Benefits of attending\u00a0public schools\n\nImagine a child or student taking classes at home.

Students would benefit to attend classes in school rather than attending class at home because students can become active, getting enough information, and having the ability to share ideas.\n\nAttending public\u00a0schools can persuade students to become active. Teachers can also persuade students to become active as well. Teachers wants students to have fun.\u00a0For an example, physical education, or for short PE. It is\u00a0a program\u00a0in school for children to have exercise and training. Teachers would allow students to play inside or outside. Even if students do not want to participate.\n\nNot only schools\u00a0let students become active in class, but also\u00a0offers information to students who need help. Getting information can help students to become better at understanding things that students learned\u00a0in school. It is important to know why students want to learn. For an example, students staying after school for help. Staying after school can help students\u00a0study\u00a0for a test. If a student needs help or needs more information, do not be afraid to ask for help. A teacher will be there to help you. Teachers can\u00a0give their best to answer student's questions.\n\nNot only schools can persuade students to become active and offers information to students, but also shares\u00a0ideas. Sharing ideas can help students as well. Students can share their ideas other students. For an example, completing assignments in a group. Students love being with partners or group to solve problems. Students would listen to others student's opinion or debate and see if they agree or disagree. It is always helpful to be with a group and not be alone by yourself.\n\nIn public\u00a0schools, students can become active, can get\u00a0information that they need, and let\u00a0students share their ideas. That is why it is important for children to go to school. Home schools are different than public schools. Home schools can be very challenging for some students.

Then you'll have to change. with the online classes you can wear anything and stay home and you wont need to stress about what to wear.\n\nmost students usually take showers before school. they either take it before they sleep or when they wake up. some students do both to smell good. that causes them do miss the bus and effects on there lesson time cause they come late to school. when u have online classes u wont need to miss lessons cause you can get everything set up and go take a shower and when u get out your ready to go.\n\nwhen your home your\u00a0comfortable and you pay attention. it gives then an advantage to be smarter and even pass there classmates on class work. public schools are difficult even if you try. some teacher dont know how to teach it in then way that students understand it. that causes students to fail and they may repeat the class.\u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0", "sex": "m", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "black"}, {"essay": "Students have the option taking classes from home by online or video conferencing because if they have two classes only to graduate is better to take them online so they don't have to go to school. It's a good idea of learning how to take online classes. After,they are done with there classes they can go apply to college or get a job to work in. they need to have the requirements that they need to apply to college. The support of this idea is that you don't have to get up so early to get ready and go to school. The benefit of students is to getting up early and not going to school they could get on their computer at the time they have their classes. For the students it would benefit because they are not moving from one class to another they stay in one place and listening to the classes on the computer. The reason why i'm agreeing is because they can be more focused at home on the computer with the class because other people aren't distracting others from listening to the teachers they are focused in the class. The benefit of students taking classes at home is because they don't have to wake up so early and they can have their lunch when the class is over. Examples of online classes is to not wake up early and be on the computer, when your class is going to start. They can do other things, while they are waiting for their class to start and be at the computer when is starting. They don't have to be in a rush that they are late to school.\n\nThe students don't have to wake up so early to get dressed and other things for school ,while they have online classes. It's a better way of learning how to do online classes. They don't have to worry about waking up so early for their classes and sitting in every class for an hour that all day in school. They can wake up but not so early lie to go to school they can wake up like at seven or eight o'clock in the morning do what the have to do,then stop at the time they have their class. If they are doing laundry , folding clothes , washing dishes or cleaning before they have their class that's a good idea. While they get home from school and do homework they don't do what their parents told them to do then they will get in trouble why they didn't do it. That's why their is a good example why online classes is a benefit for students they can do what they have to do at home, while they have their class.\n\nAnother reason, is that they don't have to be late for school while they drive to school get a pass and go to class. That could be a waste of time and only coming for two or three classes, while they could save time at home and do other things and just get on the computer at the time that class starts. The school doesn't have to call your parents if they are late to class or absent while you are online taking the class and listening to the class. Being late to school is not a good thing because you can miss work,then you have to make it up and turn it in when it's due. Some teachers give an extended class period to turn in their work the next class period so they can get it done and turned in. They should be on time for their classes so they don't have to miss work and just get done in class the same day. If they come in late they still have to do makeup work for the class that they missed. They have to tell the teacher when they see her again that they missed what they did in class so the teacher knows what they missed. If you don't tell a teacher what you missed during that class the teacher won't know what u missed and the teacher can put a zero on work u have not done or not turned in on time.\n\nAnother example, is the teachers handing out a lot of papers that they have to do all those papers in the class period. Sometimes they give us four to five papers and tell us to finish it by the end of the class period. The good thing that for online classes or video conferencing u don't have to get papers. If they tell u to do a document or presentation\u00a0it's on the computer so u dont have papers to do it with. Students have issues losing papers that are every important when they are going to be having a test or something and the teacher tells them to turn it in that is going to be a grade or going to take it for a grade while taking the test. While online classes or video conferencing they tell you what you are suppose to do, but their work they do it online they don't need papers so they can do the work if its a document or presentation\u00a0the teacher just tells them the instructions what has to be on the presentation or document what is going to be graded on. For online or video conferencing classes they really need to pay attention to the class what activities they are going to do and what is going to be a grade or not be a grade on some documents or reading passages depends on the class they are taking online. Some teachers say right away when they hand papers our or tell them what to do they say what is a grade and what is not a grade.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree to the prompt because their could be some students that don't want to school only for two or three classes and have the option to take classes online or video conferencing but they don't have to wake up early so they could get ready for school and that they will be late while they get a pass and go to class while they already have missed half of the class. They need to tell the teacher that they need the missing work that they missed so they can get caught up with the work and the class. But it's better online or video conferencing because they don't have to turn in papers to the teacher. They can do it online and submit it where the teacher tells them to submit the work in so she can grade it. The students can learn more about how to use the computer and learn hoe online or video conferencing classes work online. Some students can be more focused at home than school because they can concentrate by themselves and do there work and then turn it in when done to the teacher online.", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "In my opinion, I think that is a good program for students.

There will be a point when you will have so many questions about the topic that you were discussing with the class. When your in class at school you will learn so much from teachers\u00a0by giving out examples that are being giving out to the class and explaining it to you. But if your taking an online course It's defenitly more difficult for you to understand the main idea of the lesson. We won't have a teacher right next to us. We have to work indepentdently with out a friends help. It's not similar to when your in class and you ask a friend for help, they will love to help you out. Online class you won't have a friend helping you out. We have to take so many notes in order to understand the objective of the\u00a0lesson. I personally had so much trouble with the online class, I had to take about 3-5 lessons each\u00a0day, I had to write down notes for each lesson, I had to take at least five quizzes each day. I had to re-read the lesson like threes time in order to understand and\u00a0capture the important facts. Honestly you learn how to be more organize and independent each day.

That shouldn't be the case if you stay home and take the online class, It's because to there was a purpose. If we don't pay attention to what we are doing, and we are paying more attention to our phones we will never learn anything abiut the course. That could cause use to fail the class. Than, we got to re-teake the class.\n\nIn my opinion I will also agree to some student that wants to take the online class because you can wake up late, taking you time to eat breakfast. It's not like going to school having to get up so early, not having the time to eat, and having to chase the school bus. I'm that type of person that loves to sleep.

The responsabilitie of attend should be more but more confortable becuase is in home. The attandence from the ones than does not like to came to school will increase or from the ones that loves to skip just because they do not like to being in school.\n\nOne of the main reasons is the weather, sometimes is because of snow, rain and there is too cold schools are closed. There is so dangerous to the busses, to the ones who drive or who walk too. The streets are so smooth. So the students who walk can hit them selves if the slide. When it is raining the streets does not look very well and is almost the same with the snow, the cars get slide.\n\nTaking classes in home online or by conference should be more easy than came to school. The students just take the classes in bed just waking up with a alarm. Attend should be good responsabilitie in a very good way. Maybe doing homework should be good too. If they put a penalty when the students not connect would be a good idea. Like when they put the detention when they do not came to school. It would be almost the same thing but more confortable because is in home. The parents would not be that worry if the kids are in school or not. Maybe they will have more to do things. Getting all the staff online should do a really big difference. They should be able to attend all the time with out worry if they get late or miss the bus.\n\nThere are things that does not benefit to the students, becuase if everyone is agree with that what is going to happen to the ones that does not have access to internet in home. That is not going to be for benefit for others. Not all of us have access to internet and they prefer to go to school because of that.

In school we provide the services of the counselor,\u00a0after school sessions or tutoring. The students are not going to have all of that in home.

A lot of social media that we prefer to being looking and checking all that staff than taking the classes. In school the teachers, securities are there to say what is good and what not. In home they are going to do what they want.\n\nI think the last 2 grades of schools should take the classes from home, because they already know what they want to do. The teachers from schools should take more attention to the others grades to get them ready from when they are going to take the ones online.\n\nThe teachers from schools can talk about it in the conferences that they have to assign online classes to the students who they think is going to handle it and is going to have the responsabilitie to take it.

If they have like four\u00a0classes and they only have to\u00a0come for two classes each day and they will have\u00a0the rest of the day to work and study anything they want to do .\n\nComputer is something that make your work easier you can do your work so fast. If students take online classes they will be really good for them because they can learn how the world is changing. The technology that we have now or today\u00a0its really good and progress they can use computer to do their work done as fast as they want. Students can do their homework on the computer now and send it to their\u00a0teachers. Online classes its more easier than normal schools time. Online classes helps students to pass the class to fast in the normal school time you have to study a class for one year but in\u00a0online you can finish it in one week its more helpful.\n\nOnline classes makes students do their work alone their is nobody to help them or cheat on the works. Online classes is really good for those students that are going to sleep in the during classes not doing their work playing around. If they take it online they will have to work because they pay for it to get the class. Online classes makes students to do their work by them self. Working alone or by them self make them understand something they will learn something. They should work by them self so that they can learn some new method. If\u00a0they do a mistake they will learn by their mistakes. By online classes students will show and improve their skills by\u00a0computer without of teachers helps.\n\nIn conclusion,The offer or the option\u00a0that some schools give to the students its a really good opportunity for them to take an action\u00a0and take online classes the option that schools give to the students its going to help students to graduate early.", "sex": "m", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "asian"}, {"essay": "I think that if students have access to attend classes from home it would be really helpful in many ways .They would not be distracted by friends and other things, they would pay more attention in\u00a0what they are doing and they would be able to do all their work and have better opportunity s on learning more in a easy way.\n\nMany students have different ways to learn,study\u00a0and also get their work done in many ways such as,some students likes to learn and study in a quiet place where there is no distractions and there is no people around, and in a class where they feel comfortable in and they know they can express their self in many ways and they know that they are not going to struggle a lot because they would be able to ask questions and they would get help if they need to .There are students that they can learn and study in a class where they are many noises and distractions and might struggle a little and they would be able to get their questions answered if they need help on something but they would still do all their work and everything that they need to do to have good grades.

In my opinion as a student this's good idea because, some students live by their own or they help their parents economic. In the other side, the students will be more familiar with technology and also, almost all students have internet access\u00a0at home, and this would make more easy for them. In the other hand some people are disagree with this idea because some students are not familiar with technology and they are not be able to have internet access, but in this cases the school and the government could support them with technology. The distance learning will build a better future for students and society.\n\nthe online classes will have a positive change in their daily life. for example, the time that students use to prepare them and when they took a bus to the school, this time they can used to sleep more or even start the classes early during this time. Some students already have a job to save money for college, so they will have more benefits because, they will have more time to manage\u00a0their time to do homework and work, in this way they be less stressful. By the way this can also change their social interaction.\n\nTherefore. Their video conferencing classes will have more interaction with the teacher and if the student need help then the teacher will have more time to them. In the other side the relationship between the student and their friends, they can use the time after school to hand out and enjoy their free time and at the same time this benefits their classes because they don't get distracting during class. By the way the regular school have alert and their close the school.\n\nThe reasons why the regular school lose so many classes is because the weather but the online classes represent a better option, because the students can attend classes from home and they are safe, they don't have to being in a dangerous situation, like take the bus when is snowing. So, they can continue their classes like a regular day.\n\nIn conclusion the online classes represent a better option and have more opportunities for those students that have to work and study at the same time.

Distance learning is being explained in the prompt it says \"distance learning is\u00a0an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing\". I think that this option that some schools offer to their students benefits them in many ways. For example the food and transportation are tow big things that some students worry about. This essay will contain the benefits that this option will provide and some of them might apply to you\n\nSome benefits that students will have being in\u00a0this program are the food and transportation. Let's say that a middle school students always have problems with transportation because their parents work and he have to wait thirty minutes after school everyday, in this case this option that the school offers will be beneficial for him. Another thing is the food. There are some students that do not like food from school some of them bring their own food but some of them opt for not eating anything the whole day. Last year I had a friends that never ate at school because they did not like the food. This option will be beneficial for students like my friends because when you take classes from your own home your are not force to eat something you really do not want.\n\nThe benefits that you get does not end there. We all as student had struggle at least once trying to find what cloth to use the next day and if you do not find what you are looking for you might have to go out and wash cloth or use for second time and no body likes that. Well taking this option that the school offers you will not have to worry about that and you can use the same cloth you had when\u00a0you woke up in the morning. Another thing are the uniforms because not every school let you use the cloth you want. When a school require uniforms you have to use it like or not. By taking the option that the school offers you benefits you in the way because buying a required uniform that you do not want is a waste of money that could have being wasted in cloth that will really going to use. This where tow more benefits that might apply to you.\n\nThere still one more benefit and is the liberty to choose whether to do things or not because of the free time you will have by taking this option. Like for example let's say that you are in high school and you like sports but you want to work you will have to choose one of them because school consume a lot of time. In my case I am a senior now and I stopped to play basketball which is my favorite sports to start working because being in school take a lot of time. Taking classes at home\u00a0take less time than being in school and you could do both things if you want to which are to work, sports or just to do whatever thing you want to do.\n\nConcluding my response regarding to this topic my thoughts are\u00a0that this option benefits students in many ways.\n\nBy taking this option you will not have to worry anymore of transportation, food, or making the things you like the most. Like for example you do not have to decide whether to practice your favorite sport or having a job. As you can see above I talk about some benefits that you should consider by taking this option and that might apply for some students.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "sex": "m", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "What are the benefits from doing online classes school at home?\n\nThere are so many ways online classes can benefit students who can not always attend school everyday. You might not understand lots of kids have different reasons for their absents in school, and this is why most kids do not graduate on time with their peers.\u00a0Schools do not see or think about why the students do not come to school everyday they just think students are lazy and just don't want to come to school; however, all people have different reasons for not attending school. Online classes could change all that in so many was for instances: stopping violence, no attending school\u00a0problem ,or it could be even helping with their own needs at home. For this purpose, I believe students should have the option to attend classes from home.\n\nThe ability to stay home and do work on the computer could make a big differences in violence from happening to students in school. Students don't need to fear of getting bullied, school shooting, fire hazard, nor getting injured in school. The benefits for staying home is you don't have to worry about getting made fun of by other students and you can be yourself. People change the way they are by what others say in school. This is called peer-pressure and kids in school go through that all the time. Students don't need to worry about school shooting happening if not attending. Shootings happen by people being reckless and some people shoot up school for no reason or tries to go for a specific person, but others get in the way. Well, that couldn't be the case if you stayed home and you wouldn't be part of any drama. Violence between students mostly happens because of what he or she said. Injurers happens all the time too. As an example, It takes a while from coming from one side of the school to the other side just to get your back up inhaler which then, the nurse have to find it as while. When your at home you you know where everything is and don't have a problem. You have a better chance of being social at home with familiar faces with out any harm.\n\nLastly online classes could definitely help with just personal needs at home. Some kids need to get a job to help provide for their families, or just need to stay home to watch their younger siblings while the parents go off to work to pay for the bills. Not to mention this is why the attends are so bad now. The kids are trying to help their family with stuff at home most can't even get any sleep with all this stress in their hands. This is why we need class online so we have the ability to have some free time to do other things. On the other hand, school just don't do that for theirs students they have to wake up in the morning, and go to school for 7 hours. Why would you do that when you could just go on the web and do your work at the time you want. The best benefits of online school is you could get the work done faster and you could graduate early too. If you need help they have video conferencing; however students don't really need it. Most students in school get their answers from the internet and some just can't comprehend\u00a0the way teachers teach. Therefore, your really doing the same thing at home but much more easier.\n\nAfter what all I have provide with evidence I believe students would benefit from online classes at home. Some might disagree some might agree with me. This mainly depends on the students problems they might not have a problem they just like to learn on their own, or just want to be independent to be prepare for college expectation. The option to attend online school or video conferencing was a smart idea to come up with. If I was able to choose if I wanted to do online or go to school now, I would definitely\u00a0pick online so I can finish school early to help my family out. My position on this issue would be it's the students choice to know what is best for them to get their education it's not anyone else education...\u00a0it's the students.", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "black"}, {"essay": "Many will say that distance learning is a really good option for students.

Distance learning will benefit many student and also school.\n\nDistance learning will benefit students in many ways such as better attendance . If students are allowed to attend school while at home it will give them less chances of not attending. Something that students hate most is waking up in the morning to get ready for school. Having to wake up so early in the morning just to attend school for about eight hours will cause a student to become lazy and tired.\n\nUnfortunately some student are born or are diagnosed a certain disability to where they cant attend school . However those students with disabilities have a right to have an education. Distance learning will really benefit those students by allowing them to attend school from home. There are many reasons why students benefit from distance learning but being able to help a child with a disability on their education is the most important reason.\n\nIf students dont attend their actual school there will be less problems. Some students are treated really bad in school , many are bullied , and also many like to be drama queens . However if students attend school at home it will benefit a child because they wont have to see other students and there will be less drama and more education. Schools will stop having so many bullying problems.\n\nOn the other hand many will disagree and say that if students stay at home and pursue their education there they will become irresponsible and lazy.

Technology could be helpful for some but not everyone in terms of studying. Most people think that schools should not adopt such way of education. People say that this is not the best way for study. The reasons people say that studying from is not a good way to study, is because students would not be inspired to do their work,not everyone has access to internet,teachers would help the\u00a0students more in person That through a computer.\n\nOne of the reasons people are saying that studying from home is not a good idea\u00a0that students would no be inspired. Meaning that being studying from\u00a0home they would not have the same environment as in school. Assisting to school\u00a0would help students to focus in what they do. They would do better seeing other students working. Walking around school during free time and seeing projects made by others students could help students to be more creative. Talking to others students and sharing experiences would make students to put more effort. People say that an inspired mind creates great things.\n\nAnother reason people argue is because not everyone has access to internet. Either due to economic or others type of reasons not everyone counts with access to a computer. Having some students taking classes from home while others who also want but can not because they do not have access to Internet does not seems good. Some students have to work in order to either pay their bills or buy things that they need and can not afford to have a internet\u00a0source.

Some also say that interacting with the teacher would help students confidence and learning. Some teachers have different way to teach and help the student to fully understand the topics. Students would experiment best learning by having their teacher in front of them or by their side.\n\nMeanwhile people still argue about this issue and that\u00a0should be a way to solve it.

It is hard for\u00a0them to go to their classes because they can not move their legs. So they would be late to\u00a0class. It would be a stress for them. Also, there are many students in the school. Their injures could get worse when they\u00a0fall down due to collides with other students when they walk in the hallway. The worse thing is when there is a\u00a0fire in school. It is difficult\u00a0for them to move quickly from class room to outside.

So his teacher gave him a permission to attend his classes on computer from his house. When he used to attend in high school in USA, he had many homework everyday, and did not have enough sleep.

Because i believe that student would not be learn anything, and they will be not focusing\u00a0on there class. Parents would distract them\u00a0or if they have a younger brother they might go and play with him. Taking a online class you spent most of you time inside not outside, and that affects you health. Many students would not have any friend to pay with, because they will be not going into a school. Also, they won't be able to do activities, and they won't experience any new thing everyday. Students can learn something else by going to school.\n\nFirst, A student taking a online class at home that might be difficult, because there would be a lot on noses for the student, and that will make him lose focus. Parent would ask the student to do\u00a0favors for them\u00a0if they are home taking online class. If a student has sibling that will not help the student to work on their class instead they might just go to\u00a0play with his siblings. The student might have a hard time hearing the teacher or listing to the teacher, because their connection might not be that great. It's hard for a teacher to explain something online or video conferencing.\n\nSecond, students won't be able to do activities outside and they won't be having any fun with friends as well, because\u00a0they will be taking classes at their houses. They are not going to be social with anyone except their teacher, and their\u00a0health might become not so wonderful,\u00a0because they will be spending most of their time in inside a house. Student will not\u00a0reach their limits if they are learning at their house. If the student is talking to the\u00a0teacher the teacher might not be able to understand the student and that will be horrible for both of them.\n\nThird, the student can become unhealthy, because he or she will be\u00a0inside most of the time studying. Also, the student will learn how to get on time at school or drive safe because ho or she will be going to a school with other kids. If the student goes in a school she or he will learn how to respect some else, and the student will learn more, like leaning about boundaries at school. If a student goes in to a school he or she might get in to a relationship and that will be good for the student rather then the\u00a0student just staying home.\n\nStudent can improve\u00a0his or hers skills by going to a school. Such's being more social, playful, and friend full.\n\nFinally, By not going to a school you become more isolated and you dont't spend more time with friends. Sometime you don't understand your teacher or you can't learn by your self, because you can't hear the teacher or the teacher can't heir you. That's why you need to go to a school where you can learn with other students. Their are a fewer benefit from attending classes at\u00a0home, and there are greater benefit when you go to school. When you go to school you have a lot of fan also you can talk with a teacher in person and show him your work or show something that you din't understand.\n\nOverall their are more opportunities when you go to a school, you learn new things not like when you stay home taking a class. You spent more time with friends and the teacher can be more passion it with you. Learning online can heart your well being. And more people would rather go to school then taking a online class.

Public school is more efficient because, other students can help you out on work and at home no one is there to ask for help. Talking to a teacher in person can be so much more helpful then on a computer .

Of course it's not going to\u00a0be the same, you will not get the same physical help as you would in a class room.

I only say this because since you are learning from home there is no teacher to really pay attention on you and most teenage kids are always on the phone now a days and its a big distraction. So I mean there are going to be cons to having classes online. Therefore the parents have to be involved with this too. Before every\u00a0online class take the student phone away or take away anything that distracts him/her and give it back to them when everything is completed.\n\nOther than that I like and support online classes.

Not attending class students can control their time more freely and are likely not to waste time. Although, I agree that there may be one or two advantages to not attending class. I insist that the advantages of joining classes far overweight them.\n\nIn the first place, professors can teach students a lot of things that can't be otained from books. In the book, normally there is just concentrated knowledge. The professor will not only teach them some knowledge. The professor will let the students know how to use and develop it.\n\nStudents will be benefited from the discussing with your classmates if they are attending classes.

If can be a good apportunity for does who can't fiinish the school for example\n\nSome of the students have kids and have to take care of them.\n\nAnother reason is that the students does not have the support of their family and they have to work for them self.\n\nAlso the family of the students can not affords the students education.\n\nThe person who received the distance learning it an oldest person who does not finish the school and that person is trying to finished now for get a better job.\n\nI\u00a0think it good that some of schools offer distance learning. First some of the students that are taking the distance learning have kids and they need to take care of the kids. Next The students does not have their family support and they have to support them self and work. Also the families of the students can not affords the student education. And finally the person or students that received the distance learning it an oldest person who does not finish the school and is tying to finish now to get a better job. because with a better job they can support the baby they have and the things they want to finish up.\n\nFirst some of the students that are taking the distance learning have kids and they need to take care of them. Also the students a girl or boy get a pregnancy when they go to school and they had to leak of school for the baby. Also the parents make them to work because they have to support a baby. And some moms have to leak school because the other parent of the kid does not take care of the baby when she was pregnant. Study in the distance learning program they want work in the day and in the night they cant received classes.\n\nNext another good reason is that the students does not have the support of their families and have to work for them self. Some of the kids are immigrants and they doesn't have their parents in this country. And also the student have to work and maintain by them self. The students have to work and go to school .But sometime get difficult for them and the time it not always log as they want to do many things at the day. And it better to have a option .Because with that option that can still working and receiving a good education.\n\nAlso another reason is that the families of the students can not affords the students education. And they try to do another thing for them like the parent can buy a computer. And with that the student can received the classes online or in the distance learning. But some of them use their phone to received their classes. Also some of them like to study but their parents cant not affords the school and they try to do anything to get a good education and a better future. Because that is going to help them to be able to have a family. And with that they prepare for the future.\n\nThe last reason that why is a good idea to get the distance learning is because some of the people that is getting the classes online are oldest people the they did not finish the school and now they're trying to finish the school .Because they want a better job and a better future for their family and their kids. Some of them did not finish the school and they now want to finished. They just want a opportunity to study and the distance learning give that opportunity to the old people that\u00a0want to overcome. And that is a great help for the people that just want a better life a great future for them and their families. With that the people who is trying to finished the school can be prepare to have better opportunities of work. And also finished the school he or she can get a better job and be able to be with their kids. And don't leave their kids with another person many time. And spend more time with them.\n\nIn conclusion the distance learning education is a very good idea in my opinion. because the people that can not go to school because they have kids or the teenager that have a pregnancy when they were on the school. That give opportunity for the people with low income. The people that can afford their school. And also the people that does not have their family in this country. The people who work and study and does not have the time to go to a regular school. Classes in online is good for does that need to finish the school. For does that when they were in the school have some problems. Also is a good benefit for those that there time is not long as they want. The people of the distance learning have good opportunity for their future. And can be productive for the people who does not have a work because they did not finish the school. because have an education is important for this country and for all the people that want a good life and better opportunities of work.

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Take a position on this issue. Support your response with reasons and examples.\n\nMany schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Sometime,the attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is advantage and disadvantage. In my own thinking, I disagree students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they will difficult to interchange, low experience ,less communicate and to affect deployment or presentation in their program.\n\nTo begin with, students should have low grade if they didn't face to face interaction with teachers. If you earn a degree from a school with no accreditation, you can find yourself with a worthless degree that will leave you in debt and no better prepared for the workforce. For instance, my friends being to attend classes and he studies online or video conferencing. Some question, he doesn't understand and he has no idea to do his work. So, he has low grade in his work. We need to building relationship with your instructor and classmates will require more effort in an online environment.\n\nFurthermore, students can slow evolution and more work. Program in general are improving the quality of their online courses, and this means that students will have to do more to prove that they've mastered the material. For example, we need to research and find the information in internet. That's make us work for more time and sometime teachers gave them the homework but some students don't do it. Some students destitute responsibilities in their homework. They told teachers with many reason as they need to go work, so they forgot to do homework. But the think is they are got no point and low credit .\n\nMoreover, students need more intense requirement for self-direction because you have to know study online is good or bad for you. However, if you are pursing an entire degree online, you will need to be proactive in finding the information you need to ensure that you are taking the right classes for your degree plan. Students also pass the concentrate when teachers teach them. Beside that,some students destitute responsibilities in their knowledge .Some students mistake in their world when they are writing the paragraph and to impede about success in the future.\n\nBase on this argument, students shouldn't being able to attend classes from home and study in online or video conferencing. I think study in online or video are very bad for you because you will low experience, knowledge, and low contact with your teachers.

However we need study more in home or school. the reason is because when study more the homework or test is more\u00a0easy for us for this is important study, and never we can study for the others if not for our self many time some student they don't want study for they self, but in the life only there one thing is study hard we can stop. and many times be a student is not easy is very hard, this dependent from us which is the most important in the life study or make another think. because always the passion for study is have more time for our study now need more study the others student need study more because this is the more important and is more easy when we have more benefits for take the some class in home because nothing is difficult in the life study in home or school is the same thing, for example some teacher need that the\u00a0student learn more because some student can not study in the school not pay attention and while we have a benefit for take some class in home we need to be able and responsible.\n\nThe second reason is about they have more time.\n\nwhen the some student study in home have more time because they take time for make another thing, some time when we study in home we find a place alone for study with more concentration, also because the school we need have student with more good ideas y for this reason the student need take the attend classes in home because the school offer one option for each student. and the student need take more time for the study because is interesting take class in our home,many times the student have more time for another thing that for study, for example I'm student, but some times I think that the study is hard but the thing is that the study is the most important and is more better when we have a benefit from the schools, for this we need take more time for study in home is not hard take some classes in home because also we need to be a good person in the future.

Its not because I am attending a public high school. There are reasons why I mostly disagree about this situation.\n\nOne of the reasons why I disagree is because this might hurt the students communication skills.\n\nwhen you have classes online you are not at the school you are home taking this class so you basically\u00a0don't associate with anyone except your teacher now since i have never took a online class i wouldn't be able to tell if its better to not know no one or to associate with anyone but personally I just dont't thing it's good for students to attend online school if you are someone that like to work with people and not just your teacher. Other students also might be able to understand some stuff that you don't understand and that they should be able to help you. They won't be able to help you if you not there with them.\n\nThe second reason why I disagree and I really don't think that online schools is not beneficial is that it hurts your participation skills too. Here in school we do so much activities connected to things we are learning and it helps very much because if you do activities connected to the things we are learning it gets stuck in your mind. Its also better to ask questions and to understand better. There might be some stuff that you didn't understand face to face with your teacher its better to ask them like that and understand like that instead of emailing them or contacting them through different thing.\n\nAlso the teacher might not respond as soon as possible and that might be a problem and affect your grade and thats why its better to talk to your teacher face to face and deal with understanding face to face that's my second opinion.\n\nMy last and final reason is that you might get lazy and miss classes since you take it at your home . That might affect your grade too which is very risky if you're not a productive and committed person to your education online class is not for you. For example me personally it will not be good for me because I am a very lazy person i am pretty sure I will miss classes either by sleeping in or some other unexeptalbe reasons .

Without go to the school.\n\n-For example:\n\nIf a student is on\u00a0his house alone with no one told him what or how he need to do the correct things, but he has a lot of question about what he is doing in his online class. He will\u00a0try to find the way to solve the problem by himself.\n\nAlso if i was in my home find new imformation and i work to much during the day then i would be hungry then i can go to the kitchen for cook something very fast and go back to my room continue with my homework.

So what my friend do? during her pregnancy she still coming to the\u00a0school i saw her many time she was so tired with her belly and then when she has her baby yet she take in her house the next classes i was surprise about it either i do not how unconfortable it was for her that a teacher was with her when the baby start cry or when the baby need to eat, later she was done she back to the school but she didn't feel ok for leave her baby at home.

Attend classes from home\u00a0by way online help this type of case the students go to work few hours and then coming home for the rest of the day to study or another option is one day work and the next day don't and stay at home taking the online classes, in summary\u00a0\"NEVER GIVE UP\" when we want something that we can't get it in nowhere only in our effort we can make that possible. Also with some help ask when we do not understand something and put the best of us all including: try to solve the problems, research good imformation, and the most importat thing that we have to do is study. sometimes the other people make feel us so bad or without no reason to be in this world, go ahead and desmostrate\u00a0to that person who do not believe in you that you can do it.\n\nDuring school year is possible learning for online or video conferencing,in the videos explain clearly what or how to solve math ejercise or another kind of materials.

It is really complicated to take an online class because, in my opinion, you can learn much more and understand when you're at school and you're teachers are explaining everything to you and try their best to help you understand the topic. you might think with taking online classes your life would be much easier, because you don't come to school and obviously you are going to have more time for anything else , but you have to realize that you're not going to understand the topic as much as you would understand when you're at school.\n\nDistance learning, also make the students lazy.

In my opinion attend classes online is a good option for student. In this essay i will explain why I am agree that student attend classes online and I will give some examples.\n\nIn my opinion classes\u00a0online is a benefit\u00a0for student because many student have to work for support parents. Take classes online can be excellent option. Student can take classes before go to the job or after. They have more time to do homework and have fun. In my case I took one class online during summer this class help me too much because i dont have to take two maths classes during the school year. Another reason that take classes online is a good option for student because some student dont have car to drive to the school or collage. This is a big problem for most of the student. They don't have a person who can take to the school. Attend classes online can be easy for those student because dont have to drive to another place. They can take classes at home in\u00a0computer.\n\nAttend classes online is a good option for student who can't pay the whole school year or collage. They can pay\u00a0one or two classes online for year. After this students have to\u00a0work and save money for another classes. Many student choose this option because they don't have to pay all classes in the same time they have time to pay each class that the student want to take. Also many students who want to go to the school or collage live by they self. They have to pay rent, telephone, food and another stuff. Those student who live bye they self have many responsibilities and is difficult to take classes at school for all day. For those student is benefit being able to attend classes online because that classes online can be just one or two hours per day.\n\nI think attend classes online is a benefit for student who have a busy schedule at school. They miss\u00a0a class\u00a0that they have to take before the school year end. Student can take this class online during that school year at home. Also\u00a0online classes is a good option\u00a0for student who don't have time to go school because they have baby's. They have to be at home to take care of that baby's. Most of the student who have this problem have the opportunities to be a professional taking classes online at home.\n\nIn general attend classes online is benefit for student. They don't have to go to school for all day. They can take classes online at home. Online classes is benefit for\u00a0students who have to work, students that don't have money for pay all classes at the same time and for students who have baby's. In my opinion for those student that I am ready mention, attend classes online is the best way to learning\u00a0. All people can be a professional no matter if they can't go to school. Student can take classes for one or two hour and them make homework or go to the job.

That is very helpful and easy for student to study at home. Even they don't have in school everyday they still know what going on in class. For example, student getting sick or have to go to some where a couple days, missing some days of school that is not a bid deal now, they still learn at home or some where else.\n\nlastly, people may be got accident, sickness and have to take a long time to take care of it, they can not go to school.

There is a lot of people be success from the slum. When they are in the school period, They don't have much modern equipment for them to use, and also do not have a\u00a0experience teacher to teach them, but they are success finally. I think the environment are not important for students study, as long as you are a hard working student and always pay attention when teacher is talking, you will be the next success person in this world. So for students attend classes in home or in school, it means same things, it's all depend on which students. It doesn't matter in which place or environment, a good student are never make himself fall. So I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.\n\nFirst of all, if students are attend classes from home, I think the students can be more focus on their class, because no one can\u00a0distracting you, It is impossible. You can only\u00a0sit on your chair in your room, and then put all of your attention on your online class. For this scene I can make a example, you are just wake up\u00a0in your bed, and your parent are already go to work. Then, watch the clock, you remind that today is still a school day,\u00a0and it's the timing for you to open your computer and go to the online class to study. Next, let's image, the house is almost empty except you, no one\u00a0can talk to you, only the quiet air fill the house.\u00a0In this moment, you hear the sounds from the computer, yep, it's Generic_Name! Generic_Name is a\u00a0good math teacher, he is\u00a0always coming on time, you really love him. After the several hours, he is\u00a0teach all of the students\u00a0who is on the online class\u00a0to solve some math questions. That's the scene will happen I believe if the students are attend online classes from home. No one can distract you and you can focus the class.\n\nSecond, if students are attend classes from home, it can reduce a lot of time from the move, like some students may walk to school or some\u00a0may get bus\u00a0go to the school, it both takes much time.\u00a0So reduce time\u00a0is very important for students. For a example, as a student, I\u00a0feel\u00a0so tired when I was wake up on 7:00 am in every morning. And then, get\u00a0the bus go to school. When bus arrive to school, I still have to waiting until the first period start, yup, 8:10 am.\u00a0It cost 1 hour from when I wake up to the first period start. So on the other hand, let's try the way on online class, I can wake up around the 7:55 am, 15 minute is enough for me to do something like wash tooth and face\u00a0etc, It reduce 55 minute. Recently, I saw a data report from the internet, it shows young teens at least need to have 8 hour for sleep everyday. For me, I think 9 hour is better, so I care about that 55 minute, it can make me feel more energy in morning. So if you are the students like me, and your school have the online classes option open, don't worry and stop wasting your time, just apply for it,\u00a0trust me you will not feel regret for this decision in the future.\n\nThird, if students are attend classes from home, then you will not have to worry about the food. For my personal experience, many students will feel hungry when they are in school, because the lunch time is too late,\u00a0study knowledge are steal too much energy from our body. So if we are attend class in our home, we can eat anything we want\u00a0in anytime, even is science class. Also, I think the lunch in school is not that health as we think,\u00a0especially for some fat people although I not. I always believe if the food is cooking by myself or my parent is more delicious and health, because we know which food is good for us, we know some small\u00a0detail that\u00a0they don't know, like what source should add to this food, or what kind of meat is my favorite etc. That's home, the other\u00a0place can't beyond it. So if you are the students really love the food that making by yourself or you are the students often feel hungry in the class, just apply for the online classes, you will know the feeling when you are eating the food while focus\u00a0to teacher, its like you're stand in heaven.\n\nIn conclusion, above is the reason why I think the students would benefit from being able to\u00a0attend classes from home. Many people know that study knowledge is the most important things for everyone, it doesn't matter in where. But if we have the free to choose the places, we can choose the place that we are more comfortable with. So if you are the students\u00a0love to sleep more longer, love the food is cook by yourself, or you are the students hate other to distract you. Then, you can consider to apply\u00a0online classes, there\u00a0is still have the\u00a0unlimited benefit that I didn't show you. When you are really attend online classes, those benefit will become the surprise to you.

They will distracted either by their cell phones or electronic devices. And we all know students always like to be on their cell phones at anytime and anywhere. Also,Students can be distracted either by\u00a0their parents or siblings which may cause them lack behind ahead of their lessons. So when all of this happens , students may be delayed which will cause them to fail and waste of time. For example,my cousin came to the United States of America\u00a0with his siblings and he was permitted to to take one of his subjects or courses online. And anytime he gets home,he doesnt get a peace of mind because of the disturbances and worries from his siblings. Due to this,he fell apart in his studies which caused him to fail the course.\n\nAnother reason is that,some students finds it difficult and boring to learn on their own pace. Because they encounter a lot of problems in their studies. Students finds it very hard to understand lessons without the presence and explanation of a teacher. And again,students finds it very boring when learning on their own because there is no form of oral conversation between the teacher and student. Some students prefer being active in studies rather being dull or inactive. So when all these happens,the students may skip the contents because\u00a0he or she doesn't get any understanding, or close the contents and go to sleep. For instance,I had a friend who was struggling with these same problems,he feels bored and difficult to understand in distance learning. So anytime he gets to sit for the lessons,he feels sleepy during a short period of time. He sometimes drink a whole cup of thick coffee but it doesn't make any changes. So what he does is to off the computer and go to bed. And this hinders his academic performance each year.\n\nLastly,students feel fatigue or weak in distance learning since they don't get\u00a0time to take rest after school. Some students even have to close work after school before taking the online class. With these,it makes student lazy and sleepy when he or she sits in fronts of the computer to learn. And me myself is experiencing this problem. When school closes, I have to walk half a mile before I gets home,and from there,I work on my assignments and take my shower. So by the time I will be done,then it is getting late, and I still have to take this classes online. I feel tired in learning at times which retards my level of learning.\n\nFrom these\u00a0reasons, I would like to conclude that,students would not benefit from distance learning because there are so many disadvantages from it which has brought low level academics in their studies.\n\nThank you.", "sex": "m", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "black"}, {"essay": "Is it a good ideal for student to attend classes from home through\u00a0online\u00a0or video conferencing?

When student learn online or video conferencing, it helps the student get more knowledge about what they are learning and ask questions about what they dont understand. Example people normally feel shy especially teenagers to talk or ask question in public. This online or video conference will help the student to able to ask questions and understand what he or she is learning.\n\nAgain, distance learning from home or online or video conference waste\u00a0time and it expensive to afford .A lot of students have jobs so they are unable to take class, such student will have to engage in distance learning through online or video conferencing to improve his or her grade. Example some\u00a0students take care of themselves, so he or she has to work and pay the bills. However, video conference and online waste\u00a0money\u00a0because some of the students do not drive. They have to take Uber from home to class,which is expensive but the video conferencing and online is easy to afford.\n\nLastly,distance learning through online or video conferencing helps students to do a lot of research. This act helps students to do a lot of research and discover an information about what they dont know and what they want to know more. Example when the students are learning,they may come across a word or phrase or sentence\u00a0that\u00a0they may\u00a0not be familiar with it. This gives them the opportunity to do a lot of research about it.

I think students would benefit from having the online option.

Because many students struggle with school, online classes and studying from home became an option. However, attending classes in school is more beneficial\u00a0than taking classes at home, because students focus more in classes at school than at home, and because school is a place where students meet new people and make friendships.\n\nAlthough some might argue that schools make students stressed, however, schools provide entertaining trips for students, as mentioned before, schools is a place where students make friendships. A\n\ntrip with friends helps to overcome stress. Not to add, schools also offer lots of programs and counseling to help out stressed students to overcome their stress.\n\nTaking classes at school helps students be more focused on the lesson that is being discussed in class. For example, when taking classes at home student will have the freedom to do other things while the lesson is being explained, such as using cell phones or talking to people in the same room. This leads to; students not having the full attention and focus on the lesson. This makes students not fully understanding of the lesson and causing them to get bad grades. Since all the attention will be on the lesson at classes in school, students will be focused and will have better grades. Additionally, taking classes at school also gives students the opportunity to ask questions in case of not understanding something, which online classes don't always provide for students.\n\nSchool is the place where students make friendships and have fun. For instance, when taking classes at home, students will miss the chance to go school dances and make memories. Also, schools help with meeting new people, learning whats wrong and whats right by going through some trouble. This helps students figure out who they are, and who they want to be. When taking classes at home, it will lower the chance for students to meet new people and to figure out who they want to be. That is why classes at school are more helpful.\n\nAs can be seen, taking classes at school is more efficient way, than taking classes at home. Even though schools might be stressful, it helps student be more focus on lessons being explained which leads to better grades. And it also helps students to make friendships, have fun, and have memories.

Probably their parents doesn't want because they scared of how people are going to treat them or they are going to give them a bad influence like going in the wrong life. Or they don't want because her son/daughter are bad having some medical problems they think that the people are going to laugh at them.\n\nThe second reason is maybe other students don't like to a normal day of school they probably like to stay at home and taking the online classes from there, because they feel that people are not gonna like them or judging them sometime students don't want to go because maybe they have a medical problems because they feel embarresed or something bad happened when they were at school.\n\nFinally if I choose one of them like staying at home or going to school i will choice to go to school because I will love to help people to explain them that why is important to go to school and giving a advice to them that they don't need to be embarresed if they have problems they just need yo let it go some people don't think if he or she are hurting the person who is bullying them.\n\nIn conclusion is that if people choose the online classes and doing at their home they are free to choose because they equal are going to study but at their home they have reason to do there.

First, Online is useful in many ways. Students can research the information, or students can watch video on YouTube. For example, Math, some students don't understand how to solve the equations, but they can watch the video and find more math learning. Also, English essays. last year, my English teacher told me to write an essay about the night by Eli Wisely. I researched him because I didn't know who he was at first, and I found his history\u00a0in the holocaust, I read it. It was very tragedy. So, I wrote it down for project, and\u00a0I found a lot information in the holocaust. It was useful finding information on Google.\n\nSecond, video conferencing is helpful. There is a website called Edubirdie. This website is use for teachers communicating with students for education. Students can spend time with teacher like 24 hours or depends on what time students chooses. Edubirdie helps students with essays, math problems, social studies, science, etc..

Those are the most important things\u00a0school\u00a0offer to students. It is made valuable that distance learning never could gives to students.\n\nThe first and the obvious things that students would not benefit from distance learning is communication. Communication is the the person gives and exchanges information to the others, either verbal or non-verbal. For example, some students have watched video, and they still\u00a0misunderstand\u00a0and\u00a0how would they figure out what they have learn, different teachers is different way to teach. Instead of video conferencing, school offers to students time to see teacher, professor to discuss their problems\u00a0and find out what they were struggling with. That is why communication so important that distance learning can not offer to students.\n\nThe second advantage to being in class instead at home is competition. Competition is person versus or competitive with another person or group, each of which is trying to do better than all of the others. The best example is the one student in class got an highest score test, the others will do whatever it takes to get higher that score was. School always creating\u00a0the competitive for students to participate, and that way makes students get more interesting at work help them to prepare for examination. That is the reason why competition is necessarily and advantage that distance learning would not have to offer students at home.\n\nThe last thing students could not get from online classes or video conferencing is the experiences and inspiration from teachers, professors. The experiences is the knowledge or skill gather from the pass; the inspiration is person with confidence and desire to do something that makes the the other people follow. During the class, not just the lesson from the math or English or Science, students would receive a life lesson from their teacher. Teachers could share the experience from their pass and motivation student who has the same the path, then students\u00a0would not struggle with the same mistake they did.

I think students shouldn't being able to attend classes from home. This is not a good benefit for students for three reasons;\u00a0students can make some tricks for\u00a0pass the classes from online or video conferencing, some students can have trouble doing\u00a0the\u00a0homeworks on online and\u00a0the teachers will have more work to do for teaching the class on online. I believe if students being able to attend online classes from home,\u00a0they can make some tricks only for pass the classes on online and they will not really learn anything of the classes. however, other people say this is a good benefit because is more easy for the students take and pass the classes. I think those people are wrong because take online classes is looks like easy but it's not, this would be difficut for many students. Furthermore, some students can have trouble doing the homeworks on online because the online classes can be unsuccessful since some computer issues or the computer ruin when the student is in the middle of the half hour of the online class. some people may be think students can not\u00a0have this type\u00a0of problems if they buy the high price of computer mark. I think they're wrong because it\u00a0doesn't matter the price mark of the computers, some times the computer just ruin for some broken tools inside of the compuers or others electronic programs and the people doesn't\u00a0know about it. In addition, teachers will have more work to do for teaching the class on online because the teachers have to find many ways about, how they can teach the class for the students understand really well. Teachers have to learn how to make homework, how to show informations that the students need to know and other things. Some people say the teachers already know how to work on the internet and the students will understand better the teacher,\u00a0but this isn't true because the teachers some times have trouble too,\u00a0they need to learn many programs for making successful work and the teachers are not 100% sure that students understand the class. In conclusion, students shouln't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they're smart for making tricks for pass the classes from online or video conferencing, some students can have trouble doing the homework on online and the teachers will have more work to do for teaching the class on online. Help students at schools would be most benefit than attend classes from home.", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing? my opinions students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, sometime students doesn't have time when students free they will be done online class or homework, test,assessment. some students doesn't have parents so,they need to work and make money pay for rent and food. some time they will be sick and they won't\u00a0attend class. some time students take action and going to visiting some place they will be attend online classes. now every area\u00a0social online. Students use phone they will looking for YouTube,and they learn some think there video. when students doing online classes attend if they didn't know that they will be taping the Google and students get some information.\n\nFirst, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, sometime students doesn't have time when students free they will be done there homework,test, assessment.\u00a0some word students doesn't understand but they will be taping on the phone and translation\u00a0from another languish or they will be looking for dictionary. where students doesn't matter because they will be doing online class any area, any place. example:-1. students traveling to bus workplace,rest time, talk to another person. many parent think students does,t leading any think at home they are always use the phone and play game, taxing masses,talk to another person said parent, But not like that one because they will leading some think there. student taxing another person students learning to spell correct. when student talk to friend the will learn to correct tone.\n\nSecond, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because,some students doesn't have parents so, they need to work and make money pay for rent and food. Students work a lot so,students not attend classes. i know how will be\u00a0going to schools they leaning a lot. when students not understand teacher enplane every think and explain\u00a0math. at schools have time what time students enter the class what time go to next class and what time lunch every think teacher make time table. students follow the rule. some students it's fine this rule some students it's not find this rule. So, students at home take online classes they will be make a time table. Schools have teacher to learn and at home we have friend,brother and sister every body teach them. if students does't have a family they will call the friend and talk and discourse to the project and homework. My be they doing go to Google and taping problem sentence and students gets some answer. Students learn to fast looking for video.\n\nThird, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, some time students will be sick and students won't attend classes. if that time students have online classes students doing homework and project,assessment at hospital and at home. Students sitting in the hospital they are boring if students have some attend class they are doing some online classes. And they students have time going to fast. Students attend classes finish they doing some plan. But, students doesn't to make plant January is to rarely to know this information because, students plan after depend school on there teacher and consular. And summer , winter vacation too and there plane my be change. So, students,would benefit from being able to attend classes from at home.\n\nFinally, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, now every area social online. So, some time students take vacation and going to visiting some place and they will be attend onion classes. students use of cellphone with at home and work traveling time so students attend online classes. schools have five day a week a class so students want to spent time with family. students want to go to vacation with family looking for new place. students want to all the time free. they don't want stay one place. When students will be go to new place students mind fresh and they think they will be doing every thing. So online classes should benefit for students.

And because it is not the same when I am attend at school classes. In school\u00a0I learn more things because when I do not understand something I ask for help to my teachers. I can say that I benefit more there than attending to school online classes at my home and also students can get more benefit by attending at school.\n\nThe second\u00a0reason is that students will just spend time on video games instead of doing their class work or activities of school online class.

They will\u00a0just spend time on other things, as a result they will not be prepared for the next level of learning. Attending to school is something different because school has rules for students and teachers who\u00a0can teach us personally, there is no excuse to learn, and there is no thing that can distract us from class work because teachers will be there watching us if we do our\u00a0class work or activities.\n\nAdditionally, some people says that students will be more success by attending school online classes because they think technology has more advances in the word and that can help students to find answers to respond the questions and they can learn more.

In this situation they need someone to guid them through the online course, or they can take a home tutour.\n\nI am, a kind of student who can benifit from an online course. In 2017, I wanted to take my learner's permit. The DMV offered me driver's education class. At that time, my father was the only person at the house\u00a0who had licence. He had work so, he wasn't able to give me ride every single day. So, I decided to take the driver's education class online. I spent less than two weeks on that course. After completing the course, I asked my dad to take me to the DMV to take the test. He told me that, you won't pass the test. Because, you are not ready, and how can you study by urself? it's impossible. I smiled, and told him that, trust me I will pass. Next morning, he took me to the DMV. After taking the test, when I came out, my father asked me in excited way that, what was the result? I hugged him, and told him that, I passed. My father was so proud of me, and\u00a0I was so happy that, taking online class wasn't my bad decision.\n\nMy aunt lives in Denmark. She is married, and she has two kids. She is very talented, and she loves to study. One day I was talking to her about her studies and school. But, she told me that she can't go to school\u00a0anymore. Because, she has to take care of her family. She was really upset and hopeless,and I was feeling really bad for her. After few days, I called her and suggest her to take the online classes. When she took the online classes, she called me, and told me that, she can't learn from the videos. Then, I guid\u00a0her through the online courses that, she were taking. After a period of time, when\u00a0she completed all her classes. She took\u00a0her deggree in math subject. She was so happy and thankfull from me.\n\nSo, I would say that, taking the online course will help students.

In the school there are\u00a0many distractions like friends, boyfriend/girlfriend and others smallest details.\n\nWhy I'm going to the school? I'm going to the school for those reasons:\n\n*Baseball programs\n\n*I don't know how the online or conferencing working.\n\n* My parents do not have enough money to pay it.\n\n*I can't speak the language.\n\n*In the school i have all my friends.\n\nto sum up, the school bring to us every things that we need, like pen, scissors, piece of paper and others things. So if you prefer the school more than video-conferring you need take the bus, wake up at 5AM or 6AM, take a shower in the morning, the most probably you are tired at the end of the day.

Is it easy or hard? the last time that i saw him he told me yes i like the program, it's not difficult, i have more time to work, in my opinion is easy, but not every-body think equal that others.\n\nIn Conclusion, the school teach you about the values, things that you really need in the future, the video conferencing program just teach you the assigments and you need to pay it, the school are free and you can participate in sport programs like baseball, football, tennis whatever you want, the confering programs you can understand more easily and ask what-ever you want the thing is learn, in the school you can makes friends and share culture, Example: i am dominicane, i share my culture with my salvadorians friends. the conferencing programs doesn't have time to take it, in the school you need to stay there at 6:40 AM, the school bring you all of you need. finally i think is most better assits to the school.", "sex": "m", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "How would you like to spend your summer? A teacher controlling your summer or you controlling your own summer? If some schools require students to do projects during their summer break, then these projects should be student designed. There are plenty of reasons why these projects should be student designed. First reason is since students are taking their break time to do school work then students should be able to design they own project. Second reason is if students design their own projects, then this means that they have more time to complete the project. Third reason is students will take a break from school subjects and be able to design their own project.\n\nFirst, students are taking their own break time to do school projects, then they should be able to design their own projects. For example, if a student is going on vacation for 80 days and summer break is 78 days then this means he wont have that enough time to complete his assigned project. If its an assigned project then this takes time, you have to do researches. But if the project is self designed then the student can possibly finish the project in within 2-4 hours since it is self designed.\n\nSecondly, if students design their own projects, then this means that they have more time to complete the project. For example, it is up to students if they want to complete the project in 1 or 2 months. They can take their own time and go on their own phase. Unlike if its teacher assigned, then this means there is most likely a due date assigned by the teacher.\n\nLastly, if the project is student designed then students will take a break from school subjects and be able to design\u00a0their\u00a0own project. For example, school subjects can be stressful at times. A lot of students do not like social studies. If the project is about social studies then students will get frustrated. So if the project is student designed then the student can do the project based on any topic they feel comfortable doing.\n\nIn conclusion, these are my three reasons why the school projects should be student designed, since students are taking their break time to do school work then students should be able to design they own project. Another reason is if students design their own projects, then this means that they have more time to complete the project.

Other important reason why school should not have online classes is that many student need to talk to a counselor for that they want to be when they grow up. and most. Most counselor guide their student the right way they teach the career we want to have in our life. but they take online classes they don't have the opportunity to chat with them.\n\nWhen students get video conferencing they don't really understand because something the video don't really explain what the student want to learn. one reason is the student might feel lazy to replay the video so he does not understand. and if he was at school teacher would help them with all their work . School should not have video conferencing.\n\nStudent are going to feel bad when they get older that they took online classes.. one reason they going to feel bad is that they did not enjoy high school life. let's Image if a student was really good at soccer or any other sport and if they had played high school they could of get a scholarship, and maybe become one of greatest, but they did'it because they were talking online classes. school should not have online classes because it take the right of student in playing high school sport.\n\nOverall, student would not benefit from online classes. they won't learn that much at home, and student need the attention to do work, they also need people to help them with their work.

Online classes make people lazy and dont went them to do anything. They should get experience of going to school so they can learn more better. In my opinion in person classes are way better than the online classes.

Students should attend school so they learn more better. Sometimes online classes might be pressure for some students because its alot of them to do it and it depends on them whenever they want to do it and they should finish before the end of the school year and itmight be more stressful for them to complete everything soon.

They should go to school and attend the classes so they can do all there work in class and get help from teachers whenever they\u00a0feel difficulty beacuse getting help from online classes are harder it is a bit harder to get help from internet because some people dont understand them and it is more easier when they get help in person and they can understand everything easily and ask questions whenever they would like to. While,Some people might say yes it is better to attend online classes rather than going to school because they have to work in the morning and they dont get time to come to attend in person classes because they dont feel like going to attened them so they attend them at home. Students dont get much things in online classes and the feel difficulty sometimes and its hard for them to get some help from someone. Becasue if they go to in school classes they can get more help and they can get help for them to go to college. They can ask their counselour about how to apply for the colleges they want to get admission. They can get know whats going on in school and they can attend many activites in school and take some electives classes so they can learn more.

It is little harder to attend both at a time beacuse they had to go to work too and they dont get time to do online classes. One of my friend jose he had done the same. He had to graduate on the same year but he was missing one class and he was not able to graduate on the same year so he went to his conseolur and he asked him what can he do to graduate on the same year so she gave him the idea for the online class and he started doing it. He felt it little harder but he was able to finish on time and he was able to graduate on time.

And students put more effort in class because they have to get good grades so they can get good GPA and easily get admission in the college they want to. Online classes are sometimes harder depends on what class are they taking. Maths class might be harder to do in online classes beacuse you always need someone to help you because you might have so many questions and it will be harder to do maths in computer.\n\nIn conclusion,I would say it is better to take classes in school so students can learn more better and its more easier for them. In person classes are always better and students can get more help and understand better. Students can take part in activites. Students get more active by coming regularly to school. By coming to school daily it helps students to learn more and they get good experience for coming to school by making new friends and getting to know more about school. And they wont feel any difficulty beacuse there will be someone who can help them whenever they want to. By taking online classes students dont learn more like they can can learn in school classes. Students should take the online classes only if it is needed them to complete all required credits they want to graduate. Online classes might help some people and they feel more comfotable.

Some students offer home education and some students offer school education due to some problems. And since i care about student education, i am writing this essay to explain why students will not benefit on their education by attending classes in thier home.\n\nTo begin with, online education makes students not to pay attention with his or her studies. Some student may be tempted to play online video games, some will also be tempted to watch online video games. Research shows that 70% of students use thier computers ,mobile phone and laptops for social media, video games and youtube. This will lead to students not paying attention on thier work which will lead to low productivity of the students. Students may not achieve thier goals when they start not to pay attention during online studies.\n\nSecondly, due to the abscence of the teacher or supervisor, this will not allow the students to ask questions or understand concepts that they do not understand. But if the student was suppose to be in class, he or she will have the opportunity to ask the teacher questions. Due to this students will not achieve their goals if they do not understand what they are doing.\n\nLastly,students will not benefit from online or home sudies because home or online studies is tedious and expensive. online studies is tedious due to the fact that you have to go through process by filling in documents and also reasons for online edeucation. Also nobody will help you solve your problems. It is expensive in the sense that you will have to pay for tuition and other bills .\n\nIn a nut shell online studies is not better than school studies.", "sex": "m", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "black"}, {"essay": "Wouldn't it be better if you have the option to attend your classes from the commodity of your house? Although some say that distance learning would not benefit students, actually students should be benefited from distance learning to attend their classes from home because it can help students who have disabilities and it can also help students see school from a different perspective of learning.\n\nThose who believe that distance learning would not benefit students have their reasons. They believe students could have trouble with social interaction in the future. They also think that it can motivate students to be dependable on artificial life. For example, my friend PROPER_NAME who rather attend his classes online and also rather spend his time playing video games and not with his family or friends.\n\nDistance learning can benefit students who have disabilities. When I used to live in Honduras, I had a friend called Generic_Name. Generic_Name had a weird condition on her legs, she could not walk. It was very hard for Generic_Name to attend school. Her mother, called Generic_Name, had to push her wheelchair every morning so that Generic_Name could attend school. Our school was about 30 minutes away from home, by walking. During school time, Generic_Name had to push her wheelchair to get to her classes, restroom and recess. Even though, Generic_Name would get ready early in the morning, she would usually be late for school. Sometimes, Generic_Name would not get good sleep, so it was very hard for Generic_Name to pay attention in class. I think that it was not Generic_Name's fault for not attending school on time. I think that people with disabilities like Generic_Name, can benefit to attend classes online from home. It would save them time, so that they can get a good sleep to pay attention in class.\n\nDistance learning can benefit students see school from a different perspective of learning. Last year, my cousin Generic_Name, refused to go to school. My cousin, had bad grades at all of his classes, at the beginning of first quarter. My cousin didn't like school at all. He would usually say that he would always be tired to attend school because he had to wake up early in the morning. My cousin, thought that he was really bad for school. I would usually hear complains of my cousin about the school's free lunch or about him thinking that he was not made for school. My cousin then talked to his counselor about this issue of him not being able to pass all of his classes. His counselor told him that he could attend all of his classes online, so he did. My cousin's grades are really good now, and he also thinks that it was and amazing experience, for having the opportunity to attend all of his classes. I think that my cousin was not bad at school, he was just not receiving the way of education he needed. I also think that people like my cousin, can be benefit by distance learning because they can experience their school year from a different way of learning.\n\nIn conclusion, distance learning can benefit people with disabilities, to help them feel that their necessities also count as students. Also it can benefit people who believe that they are not good for school, so that they can experience a different way to learn and feel useful. I think that distance learning can benefit students with this kind of problems, improve and be equal like the rest of the students, regardless their way of learning.", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend clases from home?\n\nsome schools offer distance learning as on option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

They would have more time and opportunities to organize everything they have in mind also if the student works, the student won't feel tired and will feel more productive when working.\n\nOnline classes would benefit\u00a0every student in general and it would be great if all the school's offered that option, also I believe that schools should do that but in the case of an University there should be online classes too but it would be more important if they went to an University and learn more than they would in an online class. The reason is because since they are not teenagers anymore they should focus more on learning something that would help them.\n\nA positive way in taking classes online is that only the students can hear you but they don't have to see you in person and they won't make fun of you because nobody knows each other also the teacher can hear everything you say because there is not too many students that join online courses. It would also helps prevent something that we don't want to happen, that is why it makes it more easier.\n\nA negative way in going to a school is that\u00a0a student can feel tired, stressed or depressed because I feel like sometimes school is all about passing\u00a0and what students try to is to get their work done to have a good grades and they get stressed, also if there is somebody that is bullying another person, that person that is being bullied can get depressed and not want to go to the school.

But that is not good because it can make you feel insecure about yourselves.\n\nIn all I believe that taking online or video conferencing from home would benefit students by giving them more opportunities and to focus more in their subjects by not feeling stressed of thinking what they would have to wear, if they need a binder or a notebook, waiting for the bus and being late because by doing online courses everything is on the computer and all you do is\u00a0stay\u00a0home, pay\u00a0attention to the class and have\u00a0work done also it would\u00a0help students\u00a0prevent missing classes and feel tired for waking up too early to get dressed.

Stress is mainly caused by students getting to much school work that cannot all handled in one night. Everyday kids complain about having to much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing children to work on their own schedule helps them become more motivated to work. Students being educated at home gain more freedom to create their own schedule and their own rules. Learning at home and not at school helps kids to succeed and have better grades. No only does learning at home provide less distraction, it provides students with flexible schedule.\n\nFirst, Students complain about having to much homework because students who spend a lot of time on their homework and don't have enough free time for them to relax is considered having to much homework. When they get out school and they have to practice some sports them they have to go to their house just to eat and them to do their homework, they cannot spend time with their family. Homework can limit the time. Students can spend with their friends, family, or other activities they can do. Too much homework can also give students more pressure from parents interference, this may cause unhealthy amount of stress. This is why students prefer home school.\n\nSecond, One of the best things about home school is that It can be done at anytime because It can be done at any time, children have a flexible time schedule with mean that the parents can helps. The student can work around schedule instead of the parent working around the students schedule. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers. Home schools allow students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule. Another thing about homeschooling is that there are not rules about technology or how to dress. This is good because instead of worrying about the rules, the students can focus on their studies.\n\nThird, when you are taking a test or taking notes at a public school there are may distraction that can make students loss focus on what there are doing. This is another reason that learning from home would benefit student. Learning from home won't have the distraction that that a classroom has. As a result of this, student won't loss focus on the work they are doing and get better grades. One of the reason students get distracted in the first place is because they are in an environment they are no familiar with, which makes then feel uncomfortable. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and won't stress about work. In a school, you are stuck at desk for 6 hours and have limit time to eat and limited bathroom breaks. This does not helps students at all. In conclusion, the environment at home will benefit student's by giving them better grades.\n\nIn conclusion, Students should be offered classes online because the environment is less stressful, which could benefit test scores. At home there is less distractions, rather than at school where are many different things to worry about.

Technology has helped us make learning become faster and less reliant on teachers. Technology can also help with leaning outside of the traditional classroom. Something that could be a big help for the schools allowing for students to attend classes from their own home. Attending classes at home isn't a new idea, it has been around for a few years now in certain school districts, not to mention with homeschooling. Students can benefit from this if they're sick and or injured where they really can't go to school, or kids who work better in better environments\u00a0than the traditional classroom, or even the people who just don't want to go into school to do classes they can do from the comfort of their own home.\n\nPeople get sick or injured often, sometimes it can be so bad they're put on home bound\u00a0which is when they aren't supposed to leave their home to go to school normally. In those cases the students could benefit from taking online classes. Online classes allow kids to work at a pace that is comfortable for them and if a student had a question they could have a call with their teacher to clear anything up they didn't understand. Another thing that is beneficial is being able to have a group call to do classroom specific learning, like calling the student to work with their classmates via the call, or calling together other kids in similar situations to recap with them what happened in their classes.\n\nClassrooms are for most people a great way to learn a topic, others can have difficulty learning in such an environment. With the rise of mental health awareness in the past few years, and being able to identity kids who might be special needs, some schools haven't done enough to make those kids comfortable in a learning setting. Some kids might find it easier than others to work in a classroom, the other kids who find it more difficult should be able to take classes in their homes. This innovation could make it so more kids could be integrated into the public schools, especially if we hired teachers for their needs and allowed then a safe place for them outside of the normal classrooms. Something like this could be a huge step forward into more open and accepting schools.\n\nUnlike the other two points this is a bit more up to the parents and school. Students who may not want to work in classes should be able to have a choice to work from home. This would be very close to home schooling, but it could allow the kid to be more involved in their school. An example of how this could work is one day a kid could go to school for a certain amount of classes and the next day take all their required classes online. The classes could be taught by teachers with the county or teachers specifically hired for such a thing. This would allow kids to have more free choice with how they receive their education. This is seen in some counties around the state, where special centers are created for kids who want to do something other than traditional schooling.\n\nAll these reasons are why potentially having online classing and video calls from home as a form of education could be really beneficial. Not only will it give the kids more options on how they learn but also create a change to your typical classroom. If you were to offer this to most students today they'd agree because this could be the future of the school systems in America which have been the same for decades. Schools around the world have been constantly changing the ways they teach to help better adapt to how the students learn best. This change might also raise the rate of graduation and lower drop out rates in our schools.

For instance ; that schools are really good they need to help all students that they need some help , if they offer that classes online is because they want all the students to work hard every single day at home or anywhere, they wanted to work on those classes online , and if you take classes online you can take notes to help you when you have to take a quiz about what you read and what you know.\n\nIf students deside to go school , they can take all the classes that they want to take . They can take in the school were they went but;\u00a0if they don't want to take classes online its does't matter what they want to do if they work from home by the way online , they can work in the school if they want or at home if they wanted to work really hard without any reason and if you get good grades on that classes and you understand everything you can pass that classes.\n\nThat school's give us a oportunity to work on classes online , if we want to work with other's classes that we don't have yet . For example , if you at home don't have any internet , what you can do is if you want classes online you can go to the library and work on those classes there , you are not going to pay nothing if you work on that classes , they give you free that classes that's why the school's give you that option to you and for all the student's if you are a smart student and you study really hard , you can finish that clases in less than a moth but if you study hard every day at home or at school that can help you.", "sex": "m", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "I think It's a really good idea, And students they will benefit with this idea, Bacuse they don't\u00a0have to\u00a0travel to school\u00a0eveyday, it will be a better option taking the classes only or video conferencing because is soo much easier.

One of the major reason why student take classes online sometimes is because they don't have enaught credits, so they have to take classes online, Becuase even if they come to school they won't be able to graduate because they dont have all the credits needed, Some students don't live near the schools to come all the way to school so they decide to take the classes at home.", "sex": "m", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "Yes, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home by online source or video conferencing because it will help them to be responsible by a way that they don't want to loose a day of class, thinking about a person if helping them and it can help them, when they have to take care of their childs, family or even work.\n\nOne reason, if they have appointments or need to work for economic reasons like: help your family, pay rent or pay your car.

In my opinion i think that taking classes online is a good opportunity for many people\u00a0because people can work and study at the same time, those classes can be more cheap, and not everybody have the opportunity to attend a college or an university.\n\nFirst taking classes online is the opportunity that everybody want,\u00a0but not everybody have. The people that take classes online is getting\u00a0many advantages. They can work at the same that they are taking classes, they can take the classes during the flight\u00a0or if they are in another country visiting their family\u00a0they can take the classes there. They can do a lot of things during taking classes online, and they always have free time to do whatever they want. But the most important you can help your family in home or and your country.\n\nSecond online classes can be more cheaper than attending a college everyday all day. All my aunts that graduate from high school are taking classes online and they are close to end taking classes.\u00a0They said is more cheap and we can save money taking those classes than attending everyday to a\u00a0college. They save money and now they are capable to pay and attend a college.\u00a0I personally think that is a good option for me to keep study save money and got o a college.\n\nFinally go to a university in United States is something that not everybody can do. Because you have to speak a perfect English, you have to have good grades, your GPA have to be great, and for people that does not born here and is not a legal\u00a0and just have tree or 4 years studying is almost impossible.

Furthermore, students that receive classes from home are able to start working and save money for college and students will receive their diploma as a normal attending school student.\n\nFirst, students whose work for collage are automatically signing up for thier highest goal. For example, attending to school and having a part time job for most students can be stressful and can cause most of classes' failures. In my case, because of having a short schedule at school, I decided to look for a part time job, I thought it was going to be easy; in fact, it is hard because I even work on weekends from 7:00 a. m to 9:00 p. m which is so exhausting because I have to wake up early everyday even on weekends. Moreover, staying at home and take classes online or videos conferencing will give students more time to spend on their jobs while they are working on their futures. In fact, students will get the same knowledge for less time, my art teacher always says, \"don't work hard, work smart\". This is one important reason why students should take or at leats consider the idea of attending classes from home that will benefit students for the future.\n\nSecond, many students ask: \"Am I going to get my diploma\", the answer is yes. For example, students in school once they are done with their credits, they graduated and get their diploma, for students taking classes from home is exact the same thing with the only difference that they are getting education from home, Personally, my cousin is doing his last year of school; furthermore, because he is also having a short schedule, he decided to take his classes online because he wanted to start working to save up money to attend college; meanwhile, he is getting his school classes done, he is also preparing himself to jump up into college.

Stress is mainly caused by the students getting to much school work that cannot be handed in one night. Students complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing any students to work on their own schedule help them become more motivated to work on their assignments. Students being educated at home gain more time to study and make up their own rules but responsible\u00a0with it. Learning at home and not at school helps students to benefit themselves to get better grades.\n\nOne of the advantage of homeschooling is it can be done anywhere and at anytime. Because it can be done by a touch of a good night sleep, students rise up in morning fresh and have a flexible time schedule. The students can work around their parents schedule instead of the parent working around the student's schedule when it is time do some\u00a0distance learning. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers. The students cannot always work at the pace set by teachers. Distance learning allows students to work on their own pace and on their own schedule. Additionally, that there are no misguided rules about tardiness or how to dress. Because instead of worrying about the rules the students can focus on their studies. Distance learning can improve certain students learning process by having a more available schedule and by letting them learn in their own way.\n\nWhen taking a test or notes at school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. This is another reason that learning from home benefits students. Learning from home doesn't have the distractions that a classroom has. As a result of this, students won't lose focus on the work they are doing resulting in better grades. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in a class where other just fooling around which makes others who want to stay focus feel uncomfortable. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and won't stress about work. In school, you are stuck at a desk listening to the teacher's teachings\u00a0for six hours and have a limited time to eat\u00a0and take bathroom breaks. But there is other way around, if you are home, you can eat and do what you want when you want. Because of this, students will feel less pressured and get better grades then they would have if they were in school.\n\nThere are still a few reasons not to do distance learning. There many more opportunities with public and private schools. People from different colleges don't go to student's homes and try to advertise their career options. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. Public and Private schools are great places to socialize during free time. If everyone goes home to attend school, funding for public schooling will fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of budget cuts. In public schools and private schools, depending on the teacher, cheating is hard to do. On the other hand, schooling at home, the students can easily look up the answers on the internet on a different device. So for all that matter it was you choose from not what want, it what you need.\n\nStudents should be offered classes online or at home because it is less distracting and less stressful. The flexibility of the time students are allowed to complete work would benefit the mental health and grades of the student. With a more flexible schedule, students would be more likely to succeed and make good grades. Even though socialization in the school environment allows students to make friends. The conclusion of the argument was that it is highly doubtful that the lack of interaction could affect the student in adulthood. Many students all over the world successfully take some, and even all classes from home.

One more disadvantage is that when the students are taking classes online they attend to loss interest and prefers do other things instead of do their assignments ,because they don't even care about their grades because they don't have a teacher to pressure them to do their assignments ,but everything depends how much interest the student put in pass the online classes to improve the grades and gained more knowledge .Sometimes when the students take online classes and regular school they attend to violated the rules of the school because they are accustomed to be in the habit of work at home they dont want to follow the directions of the teacher, and they also what to do whatever they want and that is not fear for the teacher who has to tolerate it.\n\nThere are some advantages and disadvantage of attend classes from home by online classes ,but everything depends the way that you uses this tools to gained more knowledge and be prepared for life .", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "Distance Learning\n\nThe program of education for schools, had develop a way for the students to attend classes from home. Distance Learning , is a program that allows students from an specific region, that has approved this method to assits class by home. They required the students to have access to internet and a computer, because the assignment for the class will be provided in a file with instructions by the teacher in charge of it. I desagree with the distance learning program that would not benefit the students, becuase the better method for learning is seeing the person and oral explenation about the topic giving examples and interaction in the classroom.\n\nFirst, the distance learning program, can create communication barries. As all the assignmemt are post it online, the student will be most of the time working and doing activities alone. Taking the program at home, he or she won't have the opportunity to demostrate the abillity to work as a team. In result, the issolation of communication can cause conflict in future jobs, as certain jobs assign to work with a partner to find a soluton or to interact with the different ideas that each one has.\n\nSecond, distraction in the learning process. Distraction can happen any time while the student is working in the class material. The computer is the essential tool for the work field, and an eassy method for distractions. As the computer have access to internet the student can open many windows at once as, video games, facebook, and many other social media apps with out being notice by the teacher making the learning process longer\u00a0to complete. No having an educator that supervise his/hers process in work can lead the accumulation of work and the grade might decrease.\n\nLastly, distance learning program, can cause unscrupulous work. As the assignment are online, and the teacher can not monitor the correct procedure that the students are applying in their assignemts it can cause consecuences. The understament and knowledgemet can be questionable by the teacher, when the student is presenting a well knowledge in homework, but not in thes test of every unit. All this can result in an alegation by the teacher to the student in the way of he/she is not using the rule of plygiarism.\n\nIn conclusion, there is not benefit from the students in attending class from from home, becuase it is not productive for the students in certain ways. The correct process of doing class material, is not garanty to a hundred percent. the students can cheat and forget the use plagarize easely.

Some students like taking online classes and some dont. If they offered online classes everywhere it would be very beneficial to the academic scene.\n\nMost students hate waking up at 5:30, 6:00, 6:30 in the morning. But with online classes students can wake up at a more reasonable time and take the class whenever they want. Waking up that early and going to school everyday is stressful for most students. Some students struggle to make it to school/class on time because they wake up late. For example, I slept through my alarm and I woke up 45 minutes later than i should have woken up. I missed my ride and I was tired and late to class. Most students are tired because some dont get a full nights rest of sleep. Some might go to sleep at 11:00 or 12 at midnight due to their jobs or their personal life.\n\nStudents would get more work done. Most students would get their work done more consistently. Some students hate the fact that work has to be due on the same day or they're rushed out of their comfortable pace to work on their classwork/homework and turn it in.

Sometime the students missing classes in the end of the year. Also, sometime is cause that they are sick ,and can't attend to the school for any problem. This classes online or video conferencing would help the student to pass the class and save the year from home.\n\nFirst, the students missing a lot classes in the end of the year. They need a opportunities to pass the classes, because when we are in the 12 grade sometime we need\u00a0two o more extra\u00a0classes for our graduation. Also we missing classes in the end of the year, because we feel tired to go school and work everyday. Sometimes we missing classes for the reason that we come late to this country, so we need more classes for the graduation. I think that in my country we don't have this opportunities to save our year from home, because we don't have this technology.\n\nSecond, if\u00a0the students have a problem at home or they are sick. If they can't come to the school. I think that\u00a0students are working, because they need to pay the rent and help their families. Also, when they move to a new high school, and your consul talk to you that you need to pay for two classes; if you wanna graduate this year. I think is hard to listen this year wasn't your graduation this year, because in your old high school don't take all classes.

This is a medium where the student can save the year, and your grades don't go down. Then\u00a0this benefit a lot students that want overcome in your studies. Also, we can't fail with our class.

I also would say that online has everyone going on about also kids in school have used phones so maybe it is time to move on to something new.\n\nMy first reason is that some kids who are slow learns in\u00a0a class with a lot of students in there class , are kids who will have more trouble\u00a0in class . Slow learning\u00a0kids get easily distraction by anything in class also more like not to finish there work and instant of doing there work they will\u00a0talk to there peers . Also there are other problems like, there are many\u00a0kids that would need a teachers help but she can only help one kid at a time. Therefor,\u00a0some of the kids don't get the help they need. Also some the kids who are trying to do there work would be disturb by the noise in the classroom which will cause the student\u00a0to get frosted.\n\nTake a kid for example,\u00a0in school things are going great for her and\u00a0she has friends and she doing good in school ,\u00a0then out of know where her grads drop and she lost her friends and now she doesn't want to do anything anymore and she stops trying also this cause her to hate school because of problems in school . This is the other reason .\n\nMy third reason is the online videos.

Leaving only one question should the projects be designed by teachers or the students. Now letting a teacher design a project over the summer rather than the student will only be like homework. Therefore you shouldnt let the teachers design it because if you have homework over the summer just like over the year nine times out of ten your not going to do it. But that does not change the fact that if a student was to design his project he or she would most likely get it done better and get it done more quicker if their designing it themselves. Then again some students may have trouble designing projects themselves. Therefore I do think teachers should design a version of the project for students that that really have the creativity or thought process to get done all on there own.\n\nJust imagine a student at home over the summer time he or she just getting out of school, going on break for two and a half months. think about what a student is going to go threw if a teacher designs a project and assign it to them. It will be way easier for the students to design there project the way they want it to be. For one there doing it over break which means the quicker he or she gets the out the way and done the better. So letting students design their own projects would better for the staff, students, and school. Making a student do teachers work over a break like the summer just isnt going to work because, if a student doesnt get the concept of the project that the teacher assigned then how is he other than looking it up on the internet which does not answer all question. Allowing students to actually get creative and design it them selves can actually help there knowledge in school and the real world. Then to go on and start the next year with good grades rather coming into a class room with an excuse because you where confused on what the teacher said.\n\nworking on a project while on summer break may be hard if you got to think of it all by yourself. But not only will you have to think for your self you will have to think about how the teacher actually want this project done. I know that you'll have to worry about how the teachers want it done anyways but in this case the student will have the advantage\u00a0of designing the project themselves rather than having the teacher design cause any confusion. Because confusions lead to stress and stress results end with you not doing your project. which in that case you can say that it could really happen both ways but the point is that designing a project over summer break where its the student and only the student even tho sometimes he or she may have help from family members\u00a0that still doesnt assure they will still get there education if their looking at something a teacher designed then letting them design it themselves. Its the students summer theey should atleast be able to design it themselves and not the teachers.\n\nIn conclusion students that go to schools where they have projects over\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

The internet is our big source that we need everywhere and in different\u00a0circumstances\u00a0and the technology is a big advance that has a lot of benefits for us, like make our life easier.\n\nMy point of view about the\u00a0student attending classes from home. First, most of the students in High School are teenagers,\u00a0if they are in their homes taking classes it make the possibility that they do not socialite with the people and they can not find a firm personality. Second, the students could have problems in their vision in cause of the long time looking a monitor, laptop, tablet, Etc. Third, some of the students are beneficiary of their free lunches in school, so, if they are in home it will be more expensive for the parent to pay extra food. To conclude, those were some of my points of views or disagrees about attend to school from home.\n\nThis is a\u00a0list about the agrees and it could be a benefit in my opinion:\n\nDo not have to spend gas going to school.\n\nDo not spend in different clothes everyday.\n\nThe government, do not have to pay a lot of teachers, so maybe taxes can get lower.\n\nWe can use a different schedule to see classes, and the other time to work.\n\nThe students do not have to socialize with the teacher, so, no disagrees and problems between the student and the teacher.\n\nThis ideas was basically what i think about attend classes from home, maybe it could be better or maybe no, the mostly reason i think is fine to attend school from home\u00a0is,\u00a0if you have a disability or sickness that don't let you go to school.\n\nMade by: Generic_Name.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "The concept of distance learning is to make education easy to access, convenient way to educate the student\u00a0and student will be able learn in there homes. while public school are getting more involve of mass shooting parents are worried about their child's life. situation like this is one benefit of distance learning in this way of learning parents are capable of protecting their child from threat physically or mentally. this event often occur in public school because of lack of security and gun control in that particular area.\n\nThe down side of this concept is people wont be able to build trust,make friend and interact with other student. this is one of the parents concern. that their child will not be able to interact with other students and being in a distance learning your skill of communication will not improve unless you have someone to talk and interact with. this is why that distance learning is only optional because it's not very effective. every student have different way of learning and skills. distance learning might not be for other student.\n\nDistant learning is not effective to people who is very active, play a lot of sports and friendly people.\u00a0that is only few of the flaws. many of the flaws have something to do with learning capabilities. because of this reason many people who is very active student will not enjoy the distance learning and the majority of the student prefer to study in there public school.", "sex": "m", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "asian"}, {"essay": "Technology seems to be becoming more and more important now. As the technology improves year by year, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But people have very different thoughts to this idea, then the problem comes. Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Although some think students should attend classes from home, actually they shouldn't attend classes from home because students might be doing other things during the online class time. And students would\u00a0get less opportunities to communicate with their friends\u00a0if they attend classes from home.\n\nThose who believe\u00a0students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons. They think it's much safer for students to take an\u00a0online class at home. And they also believe it might be better for students to study under a quite environment.\n\nOne reason of why students shouldn't attend classes from home is that they might be doing other things during the online class time. An example of this would be my cousin, Generic_Name. He took an online class on the computer few months ago. In the beginning, he was so exciting because it was the first time for him to take a class at home. And his parents were happy to see that because it's difficult to send Generic_Name to school everyday, both of them had work to do. After a few weeks, Generic_Name got his first test grade of online study. It was much lower than the grade he used to get. I asked the reason later, he explained\u00a0he was playing his cell phone during the class time\u00a0and didn't pay attention. If he normally took classes in the school, I thought he would get at least a \"B\" in this test. He was smart,just too lazy to study. It's undeniable that online classes brought a lot of convinces to Generic_Name and his family, but it was not the best way to help him to improve his grade.\n\nAnother reason of why students shouldn't attend classes from home is that students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends. An example of this would be my friend, Generic_Name.\u00a0Although he wasn't like to talk, he had a lot of friends in the school\u00a0because he was nice to everyone. But\u00a0everything has changed, since he attended classes from home . We didn't see him for a long time even the class was over. His parents\u00a0told us he won't\u00a0come to school anymore because he hated school. If Generic_Name took\u00a0classes at school like before,\u00a0he would meet more friends. I can't say if\u00a0it's a bad choice to attend classes from home, but at least not the way for those students who wasn't like to talk.\n\nIn conclusion, although some think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, I believe students shouldn't attend classes from home. They should get more opportunities to communicate with their friends, and enjoy their short, but wonderful school life.\u00a0", "sex": "m", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "asian"}, {"essay": "Should students be offer distance learning as an option?

Because her classmates was too busy messing around.

For example, Generic_Name was a very kind person. He doesn't like a lot noise, so doing his first lessons he found like a private room he could go to take his class at his house without no one interrupt him. Generic_Name thought\u00a0it was fantasy to enter the room sit down in a chair in front of his laptop, put on his headphone and started watching his professor give him the lessons.

It also helps students benefit in moral teaching, moral skills, and a way of living on your own to archieve your goals.

Distance learning should not be an option for students, it should be an obligation for all students to go to school. Otherwise they would only learn from their computer, when they should've been able to also learn from their environment. Going to school is very important; and online classes might take it away from students. Important things like ''comunication'' and the ''way of learning'' is what online classes will not teach you from home.\n\nThe reason why I don't agree with attending classes from home is because those classes will not teach you what you everything you need to know. They will not teach you about the communication which is essential for each person. The only way you really communicate with other people is by interracting with them, like your friends at school, your counselors, teachers,... By staying home you won't comunicate with anyone, it will be you alone and your online classes. Behavior is also taught, the way you behave is important and you will be judged by other on a very negative way if you don't have and examplary behavior. At school, by comunicating with other, interracting with friends, you learn about good and bad behavior, you will learn about how to behave in a good way. Also, comunication gives you access to other people's knowledge. They will share endless informations that you will have access too; and eventually benefit from it. As you can see, classes from home cannot give you access to comunication.\n\n\" School will prepare you for your future\", a lot of people would\u00a0aggree with that because they know that school will give you access to a lot of \"way of learning\". Where do you stand for? Are you on the average level or not? Who surround you? Questions like these are not asked during online classes because online classes are too lonely and boring, unable to make you ask questions that might prepare you for your future. On the other hand, by going to school, you learn even more. For example: when you are in a classroom full of people that are serious, you will certainly adapt, and then the same day you will have another class not full but with people that are funny and easily getting distracted, you will also learn how to adapt in that situation, which teaches you about almost everything. You learn from your environment and from people around you, you will also\u00a0compete with other and get support. That's how it works at school, not lonely or boring, but passionating with always having to face\u00a0new discoveries.\n\nIn my opinion; online classes or classes from home, if you prefer, are not serious: there is no competition, sounds lazy and is only done by yourself (lonely student). As a student, I will never recommend my friends to take online classes, because with online classes\u00a0you will never learn from your environment, friends, teachers\u00a0(face-to-face), or practice your communication. By competing with others, studetns tempt to do better, because they are comparing themselves to good students. They meet teacher and counselor; discuss, and set better plans for their education.

I personally don't think students would benefit learning from home because you can learn better by being taught face to face, being able to know the ideas of you're classmates, and from being around people who already know\u00a0enough to help you out. Being homeschooled would be much less stressful than from actually going to school, but if you really want to learn and be a scholar, I think you'd have a better chance going to school rather than learning from home because at home you can get distracted easily.\n\nBeing taught face to face is so much easier becasue you can ask as many questions as you need to help you with your problem. also, I think your brain focuses more when you're being taught face to face than from learning through a computer. For me it's so much easier to learn when being taught in person, because I concentrate more on the words the teacher is saying and when its through a computer I get distracted easily because there's no one around to tell me that I can't get up or go to the restroom. I remember this one time in math class I had an assignment I had to do and it was online, I could never understand it until I asked my teacher, personally, after that all the problems that we're similar to that one probelm I couldn't figure out,\u00a0I did them in seconds and I think thats because I was being taught face to face.\n\nWhen your in school you're never alone in a classroom because there's always other classmates and when you're homeschooled and it's just you by yourself. I feel like being in a classroom full of other people is better than being at home and learning on your own. Having people around you while your in class isn't always as bad, I know some people get distracted easily and not concentrate while being around others, but sometimes it's good to be around other\u00a0people because you never know whose around and you don't know if the answer of one those people in your class can help you in any away. Me, personally, I enjoy working with others or even just having people around me,\u00a0I feel less lonely like that and well I don't really get distracted as easily because I can talk to people and and at the same time concentrate on the work i'm doing, but that's just me i don't know how others are.\n\nThirdly, going to school is actually fun, you meet new people and you don't have to be locked up in your house the whole day. In middle school I remember that I wouldn't talk to no one that worked at the school because I didn't trust them, until this day I still don't trust them but it wouldn't hurt you to be around them and ask questions about something you need. Having people around you who already have been through everything were going through is very helpful because they know the steps to help you feel better since they've already been through it. Plus, you get more opportunities at school than learning from home, and that's because school can help you achieve you're goal and you're career, maybe not always but they can most definitely give you advice on what you can do to achieve you're goal.\n\nIn conclusion, I think you'd learn from home too, but you can learn more from school. This is to the people who homeschool their kids, wouldn't you rather have your kid at school where his safe, getting fed, getting his education, more opportunities on becoming someone in this world, and meeting new people in his life? or would you rather have him at home where his lonely and getting distracted easily? and it doesn't matter wether they're the ones who want to be homeschooled because you're the parent and your in control not them.\u00a0", "sex": "m", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "I think students being able to attend classes from home would benefit them greatly. Some kids struggle with getting out of bed in the morning, which causes a problem with poor attendance. With long distance learning that won't even be an issue. The students would also feel more comfortable in their own home. And there are many more benefits that come with long distance learning. For example, they could do it on their own time, this could be way for student to get ahead, because sometimes in classrooms kids feel that the paste is too slow. The kids that feel that the classes go too slow tend to get bored and boredom causes behavior problems, with online classes that won't be the case because it's at your own paste, they can go as fast as they want. Another benefit would be their eating schedule, typically eating in class is prohibited and that made students upset because theres no way they can control when they get hungry, At home they are free to have their regular eating schedule without it being a problem. Long distance learning also benefits the parents, Dropping off and picking up their children can be a hassle, attending online classes this issue is taken out of the picture completely. When their child gets sick at school they have to take off from their jobs to go get them, which is a really big inconvenience to the parents. These examples shows you that a significant amount of problems that would occur with going to school would be eliminated by attending online classes.", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "black"}, {"essay": "Today technology is arriving into the schools. Some schools offer distance leraning as an option for the students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think that this would benefit students? I believe that it would not benefit students because of technology distraction, student behavior, and the different in capacity and ability for a student to understand things.\n\nFirst reason, technology is an useful tool that people can use to learn or discover things, but it can be a huge distraction on young people. Today the technology is everywhere and it has everything which make it a powerful distraction for student's. Also, the students can copy any work from the internet while they are taking their online classes. The students will not learn anything if they copy every single work from the internet. Most students on school classes get distracted really easy by something around him, and also get bored when the teacher explain a new theme. I believe that is going to be more bored and distracted being at home alone doing conference and watching videos about the class. My home can distracted me more than my phone or computer, most kids have a video game, TV, family, and so others\u00a0things that can catch their attention.\n\nSecond reason, student behavior can be a problem with online classes. A\n\nlot of students do not respect or listen to their teacher at school, and\n\nI\u00a0am not wrong thinking that it would be the same at home with online classes. Most of this students do not listen to their teacher because they do not understand the way that the teacher explain or they do not like the teacher. So you can have an idea of how worst it can be i will give you an example, if a student do not like the subject of the day he can easily\u00a0end the video conference with his teacher or he can just not listen to what he is explaining. The student can also not enter in to the class at the right time. I believe the there should be someone near the student to tell them what to do and how to do it.\n\nLast\u00a0reason, not all students have the same capacity to understand things. Not all the students have the same capacity to learn or understand by just watching videos or looking at pictures. I am a person who need someone to be physically near by so he or she can tell me how to do things. All the students that have this disability would be affected by this type\u00a0of classes and this would make them to loose their credit on the class. At the same time this new type of classes is creating a barrier between students, teachers, and school.\n\nConclusion, the online classes do not benefit students because it can create a barrier between students, teachers, and school. The technology used for this programs can generate a distraction, and that can be a huge problem on future, the environment and behavior of the student can be a barrier too, and the different in capacity or ability to understand things can also represent an huge problem. At the end non one benefit from this online courses.\u00a0", "sex": "m", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "Research show that many students dont really like to go to schools that much. Some of them is fro the cause of bulling, dont like to see people that they dont like, which is the the cause that some of students dont really come to school. Is also effective for them and for their future to not attempt to school. Yet some students like to come to school. but sometimes its hard for them to come.\n\nBut the question is \"\n\nWhy is it hard?\".\n\nWell, research shows that 95% of the students in FCPS dont attempt to school for this type of reason. Some other just dont like to come to school for other many reasons, or some school issues. Having to come to school is a problem for some students, or they just drop out of school for some reason. \"\n\nBut, why do they drop out of school\".\n\nWell, some of them just decide not to come to school for these reasons.\n\nThey get a job, which makes them loose their focus from school.\n\nThey dont like some classes, or some people that they have to deal with, in school.\n\nThey think that school is not as important as how their job is.\n\nThese are the reasons why some students just decide not o come to schools no more, or just drop out.\n\nBut, the question is \"\n\nShould students receive classes from home using the internet or video conferencing?\".\n\nIn my opinion, this could be helpful for some students. But, I dont thin k this could be the best idea that schools could have. Nor could be helpful for some. \"\n\nBut why?\".\n\nWell, in this days we can see how technology is advancing in every single corner in the world, and we can also see how is effecting many students around the world. \"\n\nBut how would these affect them?\".\n\nSimple. If students decide to take classes at home by computer or any electronic device aveliable at home. We can tell that they can easily get distracted by any other web. For example, is a students is receiving his classes through out any electronic device aveliable at home, and they get a message or notification from someone, or something. We know that they would want to respond to that massage, and thats going to make them loose their focus from the lesson.\n\nMaking these type of learning can be helpful for some students and it can also be helpless for other. In other words, there can also be some distraction from other home activities, of other need. So, making these type of learning,\n\nIn my opinion, is not the best type of learning that schools should give. For example, I cant focus in a lesson when I hear that my phone is ringing, vibrating, or watching it turning on over and over, and I have no doubts that these is one on the reasons why schools should not give these type of learning. Is just not the type of learning that we should get.\n\nIn conclusion, students should always try to attempt to school, even when they're having some difficult time to stay focus. Even in those moments where there are\u00a0some people that we dont like to see, and I totally understand that. Because, even I dont like some people in school. But, that does not mean that Im going to quit. \"\n\nWhy?\".\n\nBecause God gave every single on us a memory, and we just have to know how to use it. I also say this every time\n\n\"\n\nquitting is not in my blood. If i fall down 7 times, I would rise up 8 times.\", and yeah. This is a long way to go but we dont have to give up. We also have teachers that can help us in any time we need them. We have to try at least. But, my number one rule is\n\n\"Dont give up\".\n\nWe also have God in our side, and he is the only one we need to keep going forward. Schools, teachers, assistance, and students. We have to know that giving students home learning can be useful.

A student can usually take the course any time during the day or week. While there are custom essay writing and researching assigments to complete, the precise time to take the class often depends on the student's desire. Students who work are able to take the class based on their schedule. Many students work on afternoon. The flexibility makes it possible for a person to complete the course, while attending school or collage courses in person might be imposible due to their work schedules.\n\nSecondly, another great adventage of online courses is that almost any type of course can be found online. Distance learning course are often avaliable from a number of collages. A person can simply use the google to find a class. While most people believe a disadventage of taking online courses is that the students can not have access to faculty a member, the fact is that many online courses offer a grater access to faculty.

A student has more benefits if they\u00a0attend to classes in schools because if the student can not understand a topic or has questions about it, the teacher can not explain by video conferencing as a teacher that can explain face to face an be sure that student understood. My second reason is a student does not have a person who trust or a person to appeal\u00a0if He/She are passing for any personal or familiar problem. In schools We can find a lot of person as a teachers, counselor, police members, and psychologist to help students. My last reason is a student has to socialize with other students to be prepare for his/her future.\n\nFirstly, if a student can not understand a topic and has questions about it, they can feel more comfortable to ask and said\n\n\"I do not understand, can You explain me again?,\u00a0if they are with the teacher face to face. Generic_Name (My friend's name) decided to take the classes online, in the beginning He was so excited, but after one month He told me\u00a0that was not a good\u00a0choice because He does not feel comfortable asking a lot of question about one topic by the computer, and when He not understood something, He just do\u00a0not said anything to the tacher who is given him classes by video conferencing.\n\nSecondly, in schools we can find many ways to be help if we have any problem in home. Teachers, counselors, any person who works in the school can help us. In my junior year I had a classmate who was attending to the school but then she change her classes to online, When I ask her why she change her classes She told me that her mom was fired of her job and She had to start working to support her family. She was 16 when that happened she felt\u00a0alone with nobody who help her.\n\nLastly, students has to socialize with other students\u00a0to feel the sensation of surpassing. If they just does not want to attend school because they are shy or they does not like to interact with other students, We are not educating\u00a0a good\u00a0citizen. Students has to feel the sensation of surpassing when they do their homework or when He/She finished their assignments, that sensation the student can not lose. I read in a newspaper a case about Generic_Name, He was 16 when He attended to online classes, He never like attend to school when He discover the option for students to attend classes from home he decided take it. because He never like to interact with other students. After 2 years he graduated, but he never were prepare to socialized with persons, and that affects his personal life.\n\nIn conclusion, the offer to learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing in not a good idea because all of them are under 18, They does not have a good criteria to take that big decision that can bring serious consequences or affect their life.", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "Student who live far or have a hard time learning will not help them succeed with there classes Teachers are feeling worried about there Student and they try everything to help. So the Teacher report to the Principal and notice the score are very low. They have to find a way to make there student successful, so they had a meeting and suggest that Student should do there assignment at home they called Home School.\n\nHome school is a program to allow Student to do there homework, quizzes, assignments, and tests. This program help the Student to become successful, Student give there thought about home school and they say is more easy then School. What good about home School that you can stay at Home, eat your lunch watch T.V, and you will still have time to do your assignment on time.\n\nBut some other Student didn't want to be home school because they feel them self bored in home.

Student often get Home School because they probably don't\u00a0have schools in there location but Parents want the best for there kids to have a good education so they gotta do whatever it takes to have there kids to become successful in the future.\n\nIf I was in the position or suggestion on the issue I would let the Student know to should take regular school. Because you will have better chances to succeed better then home school you will still have your friend in fact they can even help you with your assignments, even better chances to get to college with Teacher help you will know more information to be ready in the future.

Students who decides to work and\u00a0help their families; porting money, somehow they get more opportunities and experiences in life.\u00a0Those students that help their families with money, somehow they are learning how to be independent.\n\nBy providing\u00a0classes online, somehow we are helping the parents to keep their sons and daughters in the right path, because sometimes students choice to be with the wrong people, by let students attend classes from home, their parents could be aware of what kind of people they are meeting with. By accepting the rules, students will learn\u00a0responsibility and discipline as well.\n\nAs a matter of facts, students have the opportunity\u00a0to spend time with their families, as we all know\u00a0the support of your family\u00a0is the most important thing a student can have. Somehow your family have a great influence in your future, and spending time with them would get you in the right path. However, some students don't have the support from their families, which means those students got to work\u00a0and sometimes they don't have the opportunity to come to school, give them the opportunity to take classes online would help them to get prepare for their life and most important;their future.\n\nIn facts, online classes would help those students that are interest in continue their studies in the University or College, by give them time to prepare themselves in an specific area, and\u00a0get knowledge in that area. For example, if a student is interesting in human services, he/she could get a job related with that area, specializing\u00a0her/himself with what she/he wants for her/him life. Making it easier for her/him in the College or University\u00a0because she/he would be prepare for whats coming in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, some students don't have any support from their families and they don't speak enough English, which means the can't come to school because of their jobs. Online classes would be a great start for those students to learn English and prepare themselves. Somehow this will show the students that they are capable of so much more, the only thing they need to do is work hard, and they will accomplish all their goals. Hope is a great thing we all should have, and have hope that everybody could become or accomplish all their goals, and all those people can change the world; it means a lot to me.\n\nAs a result of online classes; not only students will get benefit, but the country as well. By giving online classes, somehow we are preparing students, students who will make a different in the future, students who will make a better U.S.A for our kids. Therefore, we should give this opportunities to students who wants to become better, day by day.\n\nIsn't that what you want?\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

attend classes from home? What do you guys think that student can do it on there own?.Many student learn in different ways;some students like to\u00a0work together and others like to work alone in a quiet place where they can focus on there work or what they are thinking;other students like to play around and not do there work. I feel like we would be more successful if we had a little more time in out class if we work in a quiet place. we will be something in life by taking this classes from home and not wasting time with our life. This are my two reason why I said it was a good idea and a bad idea that student would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.\n\nThe reason why i said yes,students would get benefits from being able to attend classes from home. You would have more time to do work at home. Will be able to work in a quite place where no one can bother you or lose focus from your work. If you have any emergency or have not finish your work you can always go back to it at any time. I fell like you would be able to move on and learn more then others that don't work you pace. On the other hand some students need more classes to graduate or to catch up with their credits. If you finish early you would be able to have time with your family,friend or have time to sleep. I feel like you would be able to do it when you try your best with and taking time with it. It's good because you can get work done without anyone bothering you it just you and the computer.\n\nThe reason why i said no,students would not get benefits from being able to attend classes from home Because some student like to be lazy to do their work. When it come to work at home we would rather slept the whole day. we would have forgotten that we had work to because it just slip out of my mind or doing something important. we would have been getting work in late so it won't be counted as full credit. They would rather be doing other thing,for an example playing video games,be playing outside,or being lazy all day long. There might be a question that you may not know and ask someone else and they might not know ether. The reason i said no was because not all student would not\u00a0try to get there work done or not try there best to keep up what they need. Some teacher think we can or we can not because we have proven our self to them. Half of us don't learn and still mess around with other people then doing work that we are suppose to do and learn new thing.\n\nIn conclusion this are my reason why students would or wouldn't get benefit by being able to attend classes at home. In my knowledge students are taking classes from home. What i know is that some student are trying there best and other are are just giving up on it. I know that i am suppose to take a class at home to catch up with my credits. i am going to try my best to try to get a good income. I hope i would not get a bad benefit out of this. It's our chose to take the class or not only if we need it and only if you want to be successful in life.", "sex": "f", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "On my Opinion i think is a good way to the student that they can take classes on online or on video chat is a good way to do it, because some students sometimes some of then they live so far of the school so they dont have other way to educate they self and i think is a good communication to learn.\n\nIs a good benefit because is a easy way to do it, easy and fast and is good too because sometimes some days is snowing and when is snowing all school are closed. And they close the school because the students can not trasportate to the like that because the streets are freeze and really complicate to transport to the school.\n\nIf i have to take classes on online or video chat i will because more easy for me and is not difficult to learn on online or video chat. And because i can have more free time i can do more things and i can have a job.\n\nAnd think too for some student is not good because they dont have the opportunity to have a computer t do they classes online or they dont have internet is difficult for them. Is a good option online classes but not for all students some of them are benefit and some of them dot.\n\nOnly classes are a good reason to use because is a good way to cominitate in a\u00a0long distance, but Free online schools, have to be free all schools online for all students they dont have to pay nothing.\n\nThe time if they take online classes they they go not miss nothing because they can star when they want.\n\nOn my oponion is a goog way to do it.\u00a0   \u00a0", "sex": "m", "grade_level": "12", "ethnicity": "hispanic"}, {"essay": "Yes I\u00a0agree with this quote, beacuse every students have a chance to learn, so in my opinion, I think\u00a0that is a great opportunity, for all of\u00a0them to learn.
