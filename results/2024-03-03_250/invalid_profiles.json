[2] connection: in my world, there are five relevant areas in which two people can connect: physical, mental, emotional, spiritual and energetic. all are important for a sustainable long-term intimate relationship. but of course there are different types of relationships, and it sometimes takes a while to figure out what the appropriate type is for the two people involved. indeed, there are more and more complications at every turn. so it goes.  so back to the five levels. two people may well connect on one or more, but to have a sustainable long-term intimate relationship, one needs (or at least i do) to connect on all five. a sign of my maturity, of late, is that i no longer believe that 100% connection on all levels is necessary, but i do think 80% or so on at least most of them is.  but of course people change in both the long and the short term.  anyway, without going on too long here, i hope you get the outline at least of what i'm looking for. i really am open to and hoping to find my life's partner, and to spending the rest of our lives exploring intimacy, connection and joy together in all the relevant ways. wouldn't that be lovely! in the meantime, however, i hope to enjoy the process of finding her, however long that takes.  my main motivating factor in life is to penetrate beneath the surface into the juicy heart of things, thereby inspiring and nourishing everyone i come into contact with. in that light, there is this mysterious dimension called sympathy', electricity', chemistry' or simply energetic connection'. you certainly know it when you feel it; at least i do. and of course that also happens (or can happen) on numerous levels simultaneously, thereby also increasing the complexity of coupling. yipes! why can't things be simple? do you suppose god is jewish too? and that klezmer was the original music of the spheres at creation?

[i can't imagine there is much latin on this site; in that light, i'd like to add two more sayings: fortuna favet audaci, and amor vincit omnia!] finally, and also from the reshad field book, i was blown away in my youth by the quotation--ostensibly from st francis-- that \"what we are looking for is what is looking\"!", "essay2": "eating, walking, cuddling, reading, massaging and being affectionate, although not necessarily in that order. i'm also pretty good at reading horoscopes, hint, hint! i'm also really good at listening, and being responsive, as well as being proactive.  i am a great fan of and would very much like to cultivate a regular practice of sacred sensuality/sexuality. in my world, sex and spirit are not in any way irreconcilable.  i'm not particularly good at sitting idly by, or waiting for stuff to happen.  i am also very good at picking produce, both fruits and vegetables.", "essay3": "my intense blue eyes and my smile, perhaps also my posture. they probably also notice that i can be wildly flirtatious, although i've done my best in later years to keep this more under my hat. i can't help it; there's nothing i'd rather have on the end of my line of sight that a beautiful inspiring magnificent woman.", "essay4": "my favorite novel overall is apuleius's golden ass; the most inspiring work of history i've read is frances yates's giordano bruno and the hermetic tradition. i also love tom robbins and alan watts. let's not forget kurt vonnegut, another scorpio with midwestern tendencies. i've also been inspired by the work of franz kafka, who seems to have understood the fundamental absurdities of life more clearly than most. my favorite is the trial. i fear, however, that i don't read much fiction, considering truth to not only be more interesting, but often more beautiful as well.  another of my favorite books is james hillman's brilliant and provocative revisioning psychology.  i also love alan watts's books, including his beautifully titled autobiography: \"in my own way.\" in it, he said that his main goals in life were to \"screw the inscrutable and eff the ineffable.\" i couldn't agree more!  my favorite movies are wings of desire and the wizard of oz. that said, i love cinema of many varieties. i lived in new york last year. one of the best parts about being there was becoming a member of moma, which allowed me access to their amazing film program, where, among other things, i saw the opening of winter's bone, with the director and a number of the actors. what an amazing film.  the best thing i've seen lately though is 'the disappearance of alice creed.' truly brilliant, however disturbing.  and of course i'm a great lover of italian cinema, especially fellini, and within his ouvre, the satyricon.  i love a broad range of music. my favorite bands are u2, bruce springsteen, the doors, and more recently dave matthews and the red hot chili peppers. i also love stravinsky's rites of spring and anything by chet baker. i also love a range of world music, both to listen and dance to, from king sunny ade to boca do rio to bunny wailer.  i shouldn't forget peter gabriel and king crimson from the '80s. living in austin in the '80s was a sublime experience. i crave sublime experiences, not to mention a little ecstasy every now and again (not the drug!).  and i just saw linda tillery in berkeley. they were amazing!  hardly, strictly bluegrass was wonderful. i saw five great acts: trombone shorty, the carolina chocolate drops, doc watson (i hope my groove is still working so well at 87!), nick lowe, and the magnificent sharon jones and the dap kings. what a blast!  concerning food, there is a broad range, once again, but i'm completely smitten these days with an indian buffet joint on 9th avenue. i really do love a broad range of cuisines. one of my favorite newish restaurants is a middle eastern place called jannah. it's affordable and delicious, and the owner is a peach of a man. i got spoiled on middle eastern food while living in pasadena though, in particular armenian food. mm, mm. i also have a taste for polish food, but i won't go any further into that now. and also good old jewish deli. living on the upper west side last year with easy access to murray's and to tal's bagels made my experience there all the more memorable.  my sister is one of the great foodie's of all time. she too lives in sf and always has a memorable restaurant to recommend.", "essay5": "cuddling, good music, good beer, good herb, love and affection. and also my family, who are magnificent!", "essay6": "love, history and the mysteries of life. also why things are as they are, and why our current political situation is so disastrous. you would think that after all these years of human civilization, we would have figured out some of the basics by now. and we have the chutzpah to call ourselves 'homo sapiens'; would that it were so!

allen's midnight in paris, the new muppet movie, and george and mike kuchar's night of the bomb and sin of the fleshopoids. not in theaters: hayao miyazaki/studio ghibli films, um some other stuff  music!: ah so old, too! i've discovered i'm turning into that person that reads/talks about music more than they listen to/create it. i don't know how i feel about that. relatively contemporary classical music (e.g. nico muhly, steve reich, terry riley), american folk in its many incarnations (e.g. smithsonian folkways sorts of stuff, joanna newsom, bruce springsteen), strange classical/popular amalgamations (e.g. sam amidon, the books, antony and the johnsons), and the occasional outlier (e.g. janelle monae, the distillers, tuneyards). also, pretty much every icelandic musician i've ever heard. this list is neither comprehensive nor comprehensible. mix tape exchange, anyone?  food!: vegan/vegetarian food. fermented foods are always a favorite. anything but papayas, which to me are the edible equivalent of farts and stinky feet combined.  tv?: right now, downton abbey, sherlock.. i'm pretty bad at watching tv, and tend to have to remind myself to do it.",

cancer called \"dying to be me.\" since i am a graduate student of spanish (meaning from spain) and latin american literature i have too many favorite authors to name, but my ultimate favorite latin american author is jorge luis borges.  i love movies like \"the matrix,\" movies that question reality and movies that show the power and potential of every human being such as \"the million dollar baby.\" funny movies are also very high on my list. i also like animated funny movies like \"puss in boots.\" just because they are animated doesn't mean they are only for kids! i do love romantic movies as well, but i am not a mushy mushy girl! come on guys, you know you like some of them, don't lie! i like the movie i.q. with meg ryan because it makes you think about how you can be a stand for what you want in life and it's about love. so you've gotten by now that i love thinking movies and books!  as for music i love listening to music in spanish: love songs, rock, salsa, tango music!

knows what it means to live in the present moment and are grateful for life.  you also desire spiritual partnership. for more info on spiritual partnership youtube a video putting in the info:\" lilou mace and gary zukav\" and you will really get what i am talking about. i am a spiritual person who wants a spiritual partnership. spiritual partnership is all about growth in a relationship where you tenderly grow together and put aside blame, judgment, etc...all of those things that do not work. as you have probably guessed by now, i am about positive growth, flourishing and living an empowered

hoping the woman i meet will also be open to trying new things, and not be set in her ways about everything. i once heard a theory that women have a raw sensuality, but it's difficult for women to express fully - there are too many societal constraints holding them back. i'd like to secure a space wherein the woman feels safe to express her true nature.  although i love to travel, i also like to relax at home, maybe trying out a new dessert recipe or two. i often share my culinary attempts with my friends, and would be happy to let you sample them as well!"}, {"age": "38", "status":

message me, why include the fact that you failed my \"message me if\" in your first message? i guess it's a boon to me, since it makes it easier to screen out the people i don't want to go on a date

almost having an accent or almost being well endowed, or almost preferring open relationships. 2) poor grammar. 3) there are 7 available points.  \"how do i tell if im well endowed?\"  -the bad grammar alone is a turn off. but to answer this boy's question, you could measure and compare yourself to the general population, length and width. but probably if you have to ask, that means you aren't.  \"i want to suck your pussy until you cum on my face.\"  -while i like sex, i tend to get very turned off by messages that are explicitly sexual. i think it's very presumptuous. just because i like sex does not automatically mean that i wish to have sex with you. meeting for a few drinks to get to know each other is a good start on the road to getting in my pants, but if the chemistry's not there it just won't happen. also, this particular message (from a man) arrogantly presumes he already knows how to pleasure me. perhaps all pussies are the same to him?  \"i bet your over-sexed facade gets you lot's of messages.\"  -is this a come on? did you message me because you want a date, or just to be mean? if the former, does this technique ever work? if the latter, why? this is probably the cruelest message i've received. it assumes 1) i don't like sex. not sure why this person would make that assumption about anyone. perhaps he's a misogynist that believes women never like

that i could only meet that special someone organically through shared interests and that internet dating was great for other people but not right for me. but, as i continue to meet happy couples who have discovered each other online i had to ask myself why i couldn't be one of those 'other people'.  sohere it goes  with either friends or romantic interests, i believe that you do people a disservice by not being honest and forthright with them. i appreciate that type of integrity and transparency in return and it has proven itself to be a valuable 'sniff test'. this probably explains why i don't like to stew over things so you'll never have to second guess what i'm thinking or feeling. it's also useful if i somehow didn't notice the hem of my skirt didn't quite make its way all the way down my backside before i walked out of a public restroom.  i'm less interested in what job you have or what titles you hold and more interested in what you do in your free time and what things we could enjoy doing together. maybe we spend the winter skiing at as many different locations as we can? how many trails or national parks can we hike over a summer? maybe you can help me put those surf lessons to good use or accompany me with whatever instrument you play while i put my guitar lessons to good use?  i realized when i reread my 'what i'm doing with my life' section that because i do a lot of outdoor activities, it could give someone the impression that i dress mostly in cotton and carry my wallet in the back pocket of my jeans. but, with the exception of running errands or rolling out of bed on a weekend to the nearest greasy spoon for brunch, i was raised to \"give 'em something nice to look at\" when you leave the house.  there is nothing like disappointment to remind you that you're living and, no doubt, if you're breathing you've experienced it. i hope that how i've handled and grown from it differentiates me from the masses and that it comes in useful when you need someone to help get you through a bad day by having an ice bucket of beers and a foot massage waiting for you when you get home.  some of the questions on this website make me shiver but, with the person i trust, no question is too private. i am reserved when necessary and expressive and uninhibited when appropriate.  a little bit about you: your quiet confidence allows you to command attention from a room without demanding it and you appreciate that presence in your match. your discretion, humility and intuition tell you that it takes much more than a pretty face and a couple of things in common to create a relationship and your search for 'the one' may have even made you feel, at times, like she doesn't actually exist. but you know it's right when you've found someone who can finish your sentences for you because you're so tuned in to each other and entire conversations ensue using the secret language that you invented together.  you find beauty in internal qualities, aren't ruled by precise, physical requirements and realize that chemistry is an happy accident. you trust that things will happen as they may and open yourself up to it, freely.",

gentleman. a man with class that walks in with a classy, stunning , sensual woman is a man to be desired.  when i think of my perfect match i think of what my friend wrote, \"find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot (so never call me hot, cutie, doll or anything alike), who calls you back when you hang up on him (i would never hang up on someone), who will lie under the stars and listen to your heartbeat, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep or snore ;) ... wait for the man who kisses your forehead, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who holds your hand in front of his friends, who thinks you' re just as beautiful without makeup on. one who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares and how lucky he is to have you... the one who turns to his friends and says, that's her......\" the only thing i would add to this would be that he would always be a gentleman, be able to communicate no matter what the circumstances are and be respectful.

door for men. also, i believe that we are what we surround ourselves with. yes, i cook, clean, do laundry and i enjoy movies as well as the theater. i love art and have a collection of it. i'm comfortable in my workout clothes, jeans or a little black dress and high heels and when i wear my heels i expect you to be much taller than me. :). smile, i like to be thrown around on the dance floor. what were you thinking? ;) if you can't run circles around me we are not a match. you can lie all you want but the truth finally comes to light and do you want to be remembered as someone who had to lie to get his way? if your mother brought you up right you won't want to be remembered as anything else but a gentleman.  i'd like to be best friends. ;) life is too short to sit home and ponder about the past or things we have no control over. i'm nice to the waitress and gardener. you'll quickly find out that i love to joke around and i'm very talkative. there is a time and a place to be egotistical and mean so if you believe that you need to show those qualities while you're trying to get to know someone you've got a problem. yes, i can be as intelligent as the dr. next door and use those big words that some would need a dictionary to understand but i'd rather speak to you in simple words. you may laugh with me but not at me or at my expense. :)  i'm not interested in a long distance relationship and a gentleman will never ask a lady to meet him half way or to come meet him in his neck of the woods. if you like to travel and are interested in driving my way i have no objection in getting to know you.  my opinion of being with just one person is based on the beauty that comes with giving my all to him and feeling beautiful about it. many friends have mentioned how
